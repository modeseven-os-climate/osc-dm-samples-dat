  description: The dataset, core_eia860__scd_boilers, contains detailed annual information
    about boilers from various facilities, as reported to the Energy Information Administration
    (EIA). Each record in the dataset represents a unique boiler identified by a plant
    ID and boiler ID. Key attributes include the date the boiler was reported, the
    date it began or is planned to begin commercial operation, and its operational
    status. The dataset also captures the scheduled or effected retirement date of
    each boiler and its type as per U.S. EPA regulations under 40 CFR. Additional
    information on the types of firing used by the boiler is included, with fields
    indicating up to three different firing type identifiers. This dataset is ideal
    for analyzing trends in boiler operations, retirements, and regulatory compliance
    across the United States.
