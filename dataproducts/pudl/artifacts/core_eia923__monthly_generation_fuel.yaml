  description: The EIA-923 Monthly Generation and Fuel Consumption data set provides
    detailed insights into monthly electricity generation and fuel consumption across
    various plants. It includes data for each combination of fuel and prime mover
    within the plant. Although this information doesn't link directly to individual
    boilers, generators, or generation units, it offers a comprehensive view of fuel
    consumption and electricity generation for the entire generation fleet. The data
    set helps in calculating capacity factors, heat rates, and the marginal cost of
    electricity by using the primary fuels and prime movers reported for each generator
    along with their capacities. It distinguishes between all fuel consumed and fuel
    consumed specifically for electricity generation, thus facilitating a nuanced
    understanding of fuel usage patterns and efficiency in electricity production.
