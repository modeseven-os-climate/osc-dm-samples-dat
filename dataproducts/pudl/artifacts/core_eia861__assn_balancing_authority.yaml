  description: The dataset, core_eia861__assn_balancing_authority, provides an association
    table that shows the observed relationships between state, balancing authority,
    and utilities for each year, as captured in the data. The core elements of the
    dataset include the report date, which indicates when the data was reported, the
    EIA balancing authority ID, identifying the balancing authority which may sometimes
    match the utility ID of the same legal entity, the utility ID which is the EIA's
    unique identification number for utilities, and the state, represented by a two-letter
    US state abbreviation. In total, the dataset encompasses 75,882 rows, offering
    detailed historical data on the intersection of these entities over time. This
    data is crucial for understanding the structure and evolution of utility management
    within different states and balancing authorities, aiding businesses in decision-making,
    policy analysis, and strategic planning.
