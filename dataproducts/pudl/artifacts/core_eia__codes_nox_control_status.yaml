  description: The dataset provides a coding table describing the operational status
    of nitrogen oxide (NOx) control units associated with boilers, as reported in
    the EIA-860 data. It includes specific codes, human-readable labels, and detailed
    descriptions explaining the meaning of each code. The information encompasses
    various statuses such as operating (in commercial service or out of service for
    less than 365 days), under construction, cancelled (previously planned but now
    cancelled), no plans to control, and out of service. This data is crucial for
    understanding the operational readiness and planning stages of NOx control units
    in the energy sector.
