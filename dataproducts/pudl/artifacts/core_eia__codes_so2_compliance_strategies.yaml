  description: The database contains a table describing various compliance strategies
    used to control sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions in power plants, as reported in
    the EIA-860 data. The table consists of 22 rows and includes columns for a short
    code, a longer human-readable code, and a detailed description of each compliance
    strategy. The short codes are abbreviations such as BO, CF, and CU, which stand
    for "Burner out of service," "Fluidized bed combustor," and "Control unit under
    Phase I extension plan," respectively. Each entry includes a label in snake_case
    format and a comprehensive description explaining the meaning of the code. The
    data helps users understand the specific SO2 compliance methods being employed
    at different facilities, which can be instrumental for regulatory compliance monitoring,
    environmental impact assessments, and strategic planning in environmental management.
