  description: 'The data product is a dataset derived from the Federal Energy Regulatory
    Commission (FERC) Form 1, containing detailed information about pumped storage
    plants. This dataset includes 562 rows of data reporting on various characteristics
    and financials of these facilities. Users can find information for each year as
    indicated by the four-digit "report_year" field. Utilities are identified by both
    a FERC-specific ID and a manually assigned PUDL (Public Utility Data Liberation)
    ID, ensuring unique identification within the dataset. Each utility''s name is
    also provided for human readability.


    Each pumped storage plant is identified by its reported name, which may not be
    consistently formatted across different records for the same plant. Additionally,
    a unique "record_id" helps trace each entry back to its original source in the
    FERC Form 1, ensuring data integrity and traceability. Overall, the dataset serves
    as a comprehensive source for analyzing the operational and financial aspects
    of pumped storage facilities as reported by utilities to the FERC.'
