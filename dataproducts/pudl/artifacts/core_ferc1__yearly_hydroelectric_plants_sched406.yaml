  description: The dataset contains hydroelectric generating plant statistics for
    large plants with an installed nameplate capacity exceeding 10 MW. The data is
    reported annually through FERC Form 1, specifically on Schedule 406 (pages 406-407),
    and has been extracted from FERC's FoxPro database. It comprises 6,979 rows, each
    represented by a unique record identifier indicating the original FERC Form 1
    source record. The dataset includes the utility ID assigned by PUDL, which identifies
    each FERC1 utility. It also features the four-digit report year in which the data
    was collected, and the name of the plant as reported to FERC. The plant names
    are freeform strings and may not consistently reference the same plant across
    different entries. This dataset can be instrumental for analyzing the operational
    statistics and capacities of large hydroelectric plants as reported to the Federal
    Energy Regulatory Commission.
