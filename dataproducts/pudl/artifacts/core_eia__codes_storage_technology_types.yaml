  description: 'Our product offers a comprehensive dataset focused on energy storage
    technology types. The dataset includes a coding table that helps users understand
    various energy storage technologies through three key columns: the code, label,
    and description. Each entry is assigned a short code for efficient reference,
    a longer human-readable label formatted in snake_case for clarity, and a detailed
    description that explains the technology in depth. The dataset encompasses various
    storage technologies, including Electro-chemical Capacitors (ECC), Flow Batteries
    (FLB), Lithium-ion Batteries (LIB), Metal Air Batteries (MAB), Sodium Based Batteries
    (NAB), Nickel Based Batteries (NIB), Lead Acid Batteries (PBB), and other unspecified
    technologies (OTH). This data is designed to support businesses, researchers,
    and policymakers in understanding and analyzing different energy storage solutions.'
