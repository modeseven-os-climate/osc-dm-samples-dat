  description: "The dataset contains detailed information about transmission lines\
    \ as reported in the FERC Form 1, covering a broad range of statistics from 613,641\
    \ records. For each record, there are unique identifiers to track the original\
    \ source, including record ID, utility IDs assigned by both FERC and PUDL, and\
    \ the name of the reporting utility. The data spans multiple years, with each\
    \ entry specifying the year it was reported.\n\nKey attributes of the dataset\
    \ include the starting and ending points of each transmission line, and the operating\
    \ voltage in kilovolts (kV). This information is critical for understanding the\
    \ infrastructure of electrical transmission systems, including their geographical\
    \ span and operational characteristics. \n\nOverall, this dataset is valuable\
    \ for analysis of trends and performance in electrical transmission, helping utilities,\
    \ regulators, and researchers to better understand and manage the electric grid.\
    \ The data are licensed under CC-BY-4.0, allowing for broad use with appropriate\
    \ attribution."
