  description: The EIA-923 Monthly Generating Unit Net Generation dataset provides
    detailed information on the net electricity generated by individual generators
    on a monthly basis. This dataset captures the most granular data available for
    electricity generation, recording information at the generator level. It includes
    approximately 714,046 rows of data, covering different types and sizes of generators
    subject to varying reporting requirements by the EIA. The dataset focuses on monthly
    generation, although some respondents report only annual net generation, which
    is recorded in December. This data is utilized to estimate heat rates and the
    marginal cost of electricity for generation units. However, these calculations
    might depend on broader plant-level fuel cost data and sometimes face challenges
    due to incomplete or uncertain boiler-generator associations. The dataset is comprehensive
    but does not cover all the generation reported in the core EIA-923 monthly generation
    fuel data, leading to some discrepancies in the coverage of generation reports.
