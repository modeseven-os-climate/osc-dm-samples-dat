  description: The core_ferc1__yearly_utility_plant_summary_sched200 dataset provides
    a detailed summary of utility plant assets and accumulated provisions for depreciation,
    amortization, and depletion as reported annually at the end of each report year.
    The key data points in this dataset include the PUDL-assigned utility ID which
    uniquely identifies each utility within the dataset, the report year (which is
    a four-digit year indicating when the data was reported), and the utility type
    which categorizes the utility plant types such as Electric Utility, Gas Utility,
    and Other Utility. Additionally, there is a freeform field for a utility type
    description provided in DBF reporting years (1994-2020), called utility_type_other.
    Furthermore, the dataset provides information on the type of utility plant asset,
    capturing essential details on the nature and categorization of the assets managed
    by various utilities over time. The dataset spans a significant number of entries,
    offering a comprehensive overview useful for analyzing trends, comparing utility
    performance, and understanding infrastructure investments and depreciation practices
    in the utility sector.
