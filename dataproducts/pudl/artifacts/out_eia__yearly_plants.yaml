  description: This dataset provides detailed information about yearly plant attributes
    reported to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). It includes a unique
    six-digit facility identification number, plant names, and their locations, including
    city, county, state, street address, and zip code, along with geographical coordinates
    in terms of latitude and longitude. The data set specifies timezone information
    for each plant. It also contains compliance-related data such as the presence
    of ash impoundments, whether these impoundments are lined, and the status of these
    impoundments as of the report date. Each entry is tagged with a report date indicating
    the time of data collection. Overall, this dataset serves as a comprehensive source
    of various plant characteristics and locational attributes necessary for energy
    infrastructure analysis and regulatory compliance tracking.
