  description: The EIA-923 Monthly Boiler Fuel Consumption and Emissions data provides
    valuable insights into the quantity and type of fuel consumed by individual boilers
    on a monthly basis. This includes detailed information on the sulfur and ash content
    of the fuels used, as well as the heat content per unit of fuel. Fuel quantities
    are reported in standard units such as tons, barrels, or thousand cubic feet (Mcf).
    These measurements allow for the calculation of the thermal efficiency, or heat
    rate, of various generation units. While this dataset offers extensive coverage
    of the entire fleet of generators, it does not directly link fuel consumption
    to specific generators. Consequently, calculating heat rates can be complex due
    to incomplete and intricate associations between individual boilers and generators.
    Additionally, some respondents report their fuel consumption data on an annual
    basis, which is then aggregated into this dataset. Overall, this data is essential
    for analyzing boiler performance and emissions, providing a comprehensive view
    of fuel usage across different types of boilers.
