  description: The dataset "core_eia861__yearly_energy_efficiency" provides detailed
    annual information on energy efficiency programs as reported to the Energy Information
    Administration (EIA). It includes data on incremental energy savings, peak demand
    savings, weighted average life cycle, and the associated costs both for the reporting
    year and life cycle of the energy efficiency programs. The dataset spans up until
    2012, after which the reporting structure changed and split the data into separate
    tables, making post-2012 data not directly comparable. The information captured
    helps to understand the performance and financial aspects of energy efficiency
    initiatives across different years and customer categories such as commercial,
    industrial, and direct connection. Each record is associated with an "EIA short
    code identifying a balancing authority," which can include codes for Canadian
    and Mexican balancing authorities as well. This dataset can be used for tracking
    energy efficiency trends, evaluating the impact of different programs, and supporting
    energy policy and planning decisions.
