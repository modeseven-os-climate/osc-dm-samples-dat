  description: 'The dataset "core_pudl__assn_eia_pudl_utilities" provides detailed
    associations between the Utility IDs from the U.S. Energy Information Administration
    (EIA) and manually assigned PUDL Utility IDs. This dataset consists of 15,678
    rows and includes three primary fields:


    1. **utility_id_eia**: The unique identification number assigned by the EIA to
    each utility.

    2. **utility_name_eia**: The name of the utility as recorded by the EIA.

    3. **utility_id_pudl**: A manually assigned unique identification number by the
    Public Utility Data Liberation (PUDL) project, which may not be stable over time.


    This dataset is useful for understanding the relationship and mapping between
    the EIA''s utility identifiers and the PUDL''s manually assigned identifiers.
    It contains valuable information for researchers, analysts, and policymakers looking
    to cross-reference utility data between these two identification systems.'
