  description: 'This dataset contains information on different types of coal mines
    reported as fuel sources in the EIA-923 form, maintained by the US Energy Information
    Administration (EIA). The dataset includes several columns with key information:


    - "code": A short code originally reported to denote the type of coal mine.

    - "label": A longer, human-readable code using snake_case format that describes
    the type of coal mine.

    - "description": A detailed, human-readable explanation of what each code and
    label signifies.


    The dataset includes various types of coal mines such as preparation plants, surface
    mines, underground mines, and mines that combine surface and underground methods,
    both with a primary extraction method specified. This data is crucial for understanding
    how different coal mines contribute to the overall fuel supply reported in the
    EIA-923.'
