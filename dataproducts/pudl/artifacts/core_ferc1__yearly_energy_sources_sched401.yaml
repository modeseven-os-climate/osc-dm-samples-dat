  description: 'The dataset "core_ferc1__yearly_energy_sources_sched401" provides
    detailed information on the sources of electricity obtained by utilities, as reported
    annually in FERC Form 1. It includes the type and amount of energy sourced, categorized
    into three primary groups: generation, power exchanges, and transmission. Each
    record in the dataset contains data for a specific utility identified by a PUDL-assigned
    utility ID, a four-digit reporting year, and the type of energy source. Additionally,
    the dataset indicates whether the values are unique or calculated entries. The
    amount of electricity obtained is measured in megawatt-hours (MWh). An identifier
    for the original FERC Form 1 source record is also provided. This dataset essentially
    captures the various ways utilities acquire electrical energy over the years,
    facilitating analysis of trends and patterns in energy sourcing.'
