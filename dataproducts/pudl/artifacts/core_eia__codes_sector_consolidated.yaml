  description: Our business product provides detailed insights into the EIA consolidated
    NAICS sector codes, which are essential for understanding various sectors in the
    energy industry. The data encompasses a concise set of codes, each aimed at a
    specific category of power producers. The sectors include traditional regulated
    electric utilities, independent power producers (IPPs) that are not cogenerators,
    and those IPPs that function as cogenerators but have a primary business purpose
    other than power generation. Each sector is identified by a specific code and
    is accompanied by a detailed, human-readable description to facilitate easy comprehension
    of the roles and functions within the energy sector. This structured data is vital
    for stakeholders needing precise and categorized information on different types
    of power producers.
