  description: The dataset "out_eia923__yearly_generation_fuel_by_generator_energy_source"
    provides detailed information on yearly estimated net electricity generation and
    fuel consumption for individual generators. This dataset includes combinations
    of generator types, energy sources, and prime movers. It allows users to analyze
    how net electricity generation and fuel usage are distributed across different
    generator, prime mover, and energy source combinations. The net generation data
    is allocated proportionally among generators and energy sources, ensuring a comprehensive
    view of the energy dynamics within a plant. This dataset is crucial for understanding
    the performance and fuel consumption patterns of different energy sources and
    generator types over multiple years, aiding in energy management, policy making,
    and operational efficiency analysis.
