  description: The dataset, core EIA860 SCD Emissions Control Equipment, provides
    comprehensive information on the emissions control equipment used by facilities
    in the energy sector, as reported to the Energy Information Administration (EIA).
    The data includes the cost, type, operating status, retirement date, and installation
    year of such equipment. For each entry, it also includes a report year indicating
    the annual reporting period of the data. Each facility is uniquely identified
    by a six-digit facility identification number (plant_id_eia). For emissions control
    units within the same plant and report year, the dataset assigns a unique piece
    of equipment a PUDL-generated ID (emission_control_id_pudl), although this ID
    is not intended for tracking equipment over time or across different plants. The
    data maturity field indicates the level of completeness and reliability of each
    data record, with some data being preliminary and requiring cautious interpretation.
    Additionally, the dataset contains short codes specifying the types of emission
    control equipment, covering controls for pollutants such as sulfur dioxide (SO2),
    particulate matter, mercury, nitrogen oxides (NOX), and acid gases like hydrochloric
    acid (HCl). This dataset can be instrumental for entities in the energy industry
    interested in analyzing trends, compliance, and the effectiveness of emission
    control measures.
