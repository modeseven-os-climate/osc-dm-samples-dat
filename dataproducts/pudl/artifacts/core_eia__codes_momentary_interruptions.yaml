  description: "This dataset contains information about utility definitions of momentary\
    \ service interruptions. Specifically, it includes codes used by respondents to\
    \ categorize the length or criteria for defining a momentary interruption in electric\
    \ service. The dataset features three key fields: \n\n1. `code`: A short code\
    \ originally reported by the respondent, such as \"F,\" \"L,\" or \"O.\"\n2. `label`:\
    \ A longer, human-readable code using snake_case, such as \"less_than_5_minutes\"\
    \ or \"less_than_1_minute.\"\n3. `description`: A detailed explanation of each\
    \ code, describing what the label means. For example, \"Respondent defines a momentary\
    \ interruption as less than 5 minutes\" or \"Respondent defines a momentary interruption\
    \ using some other criteria.\"\n\nThis dataset is useful for understanding how\
    \ different utilities define momentary interruptions in their electric service,\
    \ which can vary from less than 1 minute to less than 5 minutes, or other criteria\
    \ specified by the respondent."
