  description: This dataset contains detailed information on the energy sources used
    for utility or customer-owned distributed generation capacity, as reported in
    the EIA861 survey. It includes several key data fields such as the percentage
    of distributed generation system fuel types (e.g., gas, oil, renewable, water,
    wind, wood), whether the reported fuel data is estimated or actual, and the specific
    fuel classes utilized. Additionally, it records the date of reporting, US state
    abbreviations where the generation occurs, and the EIA Utility Identification
    number. The data spans a large number of records and is available under the CC-BY-4.0
    license, allowing for widespread use and analysis. This dataset is particularly
    useful for understanding the distribution of different fuel types in distributed
    generation systems and can support market analysis, policy-making, and utility
    planning.
