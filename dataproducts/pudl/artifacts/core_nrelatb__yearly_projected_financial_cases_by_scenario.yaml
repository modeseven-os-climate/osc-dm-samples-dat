  description: "The dataset contains detailed yearly financial projections from NREL\u2019\
    s Annual Technology Baseline (ATB), focusing on various energy technologies. The\
    \ records provide data that vary by scenario and cost recovery period. Key information\
    \ includes the report year, NREL\u2019s model cases (which are categorized into\
    \ two primary financial scenarios: R&D Only Case and Market + Policies Case),\
    \ and the projection year. Additionally, the dataset includes descriptions of\
    \ different technologies and the scenario contexts (referred to as scenario_atb).\
    \ The cost recovery period years column may contain null values, indicating that\
    \ the records are applicable irrespective of the specific recovery period. Detailed\
    \ parameters such as relevant financial assumptions and expected developments\
    \ based on R&D improvements and market policies across different years are covered.\
    \ This data is particularly useful for stakeholders looking to understand the\
    \ financial landscape of various energy technologies over time. \n\nThe dataset\
    \ is licensed under CC-BY-4.0, ensuring that it can be utilized and shared broadly.\
    \ The absence of certain values in the cost recovery period years field implies\
    \ flexibility where those records can be applicable across any given period. This\
    \ makes the dataset a valuable resource for analyzing long-term financial projections\
    \ and decision-making in energy investments."
