  description: The EIA-923 Monthly Generation and Fuel Consumption dataset offers
    comprehensive information on electricity generation and fuel usage reported by
    power plants. The dataset includes over 2.9 million records, capturing data from
    the EIA-923 Schedule 3. Key data points include the report date, unique facility
    identification numbers (both EIA and PUDL assigned), plant names, utility identification
    numbers (both EIA and PUDL assigned), and utility names. It combines data from
    both fossil fuel generation and nuclear generation, ensuring compatibility by
    aggregating nuclear generation data to the plant prime mover level. This dataset
    is essential for analyzing trends in electricity generation and fuel consumption
    across different utilities and facilities. The data is available under the CC-BY-4.0
    license, allowing for wide usage and distribution.
