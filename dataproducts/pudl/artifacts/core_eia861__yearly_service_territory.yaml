  description: 'The dataset "core_eia861__yearly_service_territory" contains detailed
    information about the service territories of utilities in the United States as
    reported to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). The dataset includes
    259,031 rows of data and covers several key attributes:


    1. **County**: The name of the county where the utility provides its services.

    2. **Short Form**: Indicator of whether the reported information comes from the
    shorter EIA 861 form, which was introduced in 2012 to reduce the administrative
    burden on smaller utilities.

    3. **State**: The two-letter abbreviation representing the state.

    4. **Utility ID EIA**: The unique identification number assigned to each utility
    by the EIA.

    5. **Utility Name EIA**: The name of the utility as recognized by the EIA.

    6. **Report Date**: The date the information was reported.

    7. **State ID FIPS**: The two-digit Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)
    code representing the state.

    8. **County ID FIPS**: The FIPS code representing the county.

    9. **Data Maturity**: The maturity level of the data, indicating whether the data
    is final or still in a preliminary state.


    This dataset is primarily used to understand the geographic distribution of utility
    service areas across the United States. It helps in analyzing the coverage of
    utilities at the county level, providing insights into the areas served by specific
    utilities and allowing for a closer examination of utility operations and reach
    within given states and counties.'
