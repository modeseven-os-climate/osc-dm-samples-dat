  description: 'The dataset "Monthly Fuel Receipts and Costs" from the EIA-923 Schedule
    2, Part A provides detailed information on fuel deliveries to power plants. Each
    record in the dataset describes an individual fuel delivery and includes details
    such as the type of fuel, the supplier, and the destination plant. Multiple deliveries
    of the same type of fuel from the same supplier to the same plant within a single
    month are possible, so the dataset does not have a natural primary key.


    The data is particularly useful for understanding fuel costs and their impact
    on electricity generation, as it is the most granular data available for this
    purpose. However, users should be aware that there can be a delay between when
    fuel is received and when it is consumed, which may affect the accuracy of monthly
    attributes related to power generation.


    In some cases, the price of fuel is treated as proprietary business information
    and is redacted from the publicly available spreadsheets. Nevertheless, the data
    is still reported to the EIA and influences aggregated statistics. This dataset
    is valuable for calculating the marginal cost of electricity for individual generation
    units and for analyzing trends in fuel deliveries and costs.'
