  description: The dataset from EIA-923 FGD Operation & Maintenance provides detailed
    annual information about flue gas desulfurization (FGD) systems at generation
    facilities. Specifically, it includes operational expenses related to FGD systems,
    which are primarily used to control sulfur dioxide emissions. The dataset covers
    report dates and includes plant identification numbers, known as ORISPL, which
    are unique six-digit codes assigned by the Energy Information Administration (EIA).
    Additionally, the dataset features sulfur dioxide control identification numbers,
    although these IDs are not unique identifiers on their own. From 2008 to 2011,
    the dataset also reported various operational characteristics of FGD systems,
    which are now included in the 923 Air Emissions Control Info. The data is carefully
    cleaned but has not yet been integrated with other EIA 923 or 860 datasets within
    the PUDL database. Once fully integrated and harvested, the dataset will be removed
    from the PUDL database. This data is crucial for understanding the operational
    costs and efficiency of emissions control systems at generation facilities.
