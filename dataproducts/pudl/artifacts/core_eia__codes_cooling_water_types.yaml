  description: The dataset includes a coding table for cooling water types, providing
    essential information for understanding the different types of water used in various
    processes, particularly related to energy information. It consists of a short
    code, a longer human-readable code, and a detailed description for each type.
    The available water types are reclaimed water, brackish water, fresh water, other,
    and saline water. This data can aid in the classification and analysis of water
    usage in different industrial or environmental contexts, facilitating better resource
    management and operational planning.
