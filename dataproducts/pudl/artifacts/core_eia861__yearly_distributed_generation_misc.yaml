  description: The core_eia861__yearly_distributed_generation_misc dataset contains
    comprehensive information on the capacity of utility or customer-owned distributed
    generation. It includes data on the number of generators, indicating whether their
    capacity is estimated or actual, the amount of backup capacity, and details on
    how much capacity comes from generators with less than 1 MW of nameplate capacity.
    This dataset, drawn from the EIA861 surveys, offers insights into distributed
    generation practices and trends over the years, including details on sector-specific
    data, fuel cell information, and conversions of reported capacity from DC to AC
    units. These parameters are crucial for understanding the distributed generation
    landscape, helping utilities, policymakers, and researchers analyze the growth
    and impact of distributed energy resources on the energy grid.
