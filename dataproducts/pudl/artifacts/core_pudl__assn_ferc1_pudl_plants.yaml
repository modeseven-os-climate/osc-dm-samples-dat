  description: In this dataset, you will find information linking FERC1 plants to
    their associated manually assigned PUDL Plant IDs. The key data points include
    the PUDL-assigned utility ID, which identifies a FERC1 utility and is auto-incremented,
    meaning it may not remain consistent year to year. Additionally, the FERC1 plant
    name is provided as reported to FERC, which is a freeform text field and therefore
    not guaranteed to be consistently referenced across records. Lastly, each entry
    includes a manually assigned PUDL plant ID, which also may not remain constant
    over time. This dataset contains 7,698 entries, each comprising these three critical
    pieces of information.
