  description: The dataset contains annually reported information specific to wind
    generators from the EIA-860 Schedule 3.2. It includes a total of 13,580 rows of
    data, capturing various attributes unique to wind power facilities. Key data points
    include the plant ID, which is a unique six-digit identifier for each facility,
    and the generator ID, which may contain both numbers and letters. The report also
    includes the date of the report, the average annual wind speed that the turbines
    at each site are designed to handle (measured in miles per hour), and the Federal
    Aviation Administration (FAA) obstacle ID assigned to each generator. This dataset
    provides valuable details necessary for analyzing the characteristics and capabilities
    of wind power generators in the United States.
