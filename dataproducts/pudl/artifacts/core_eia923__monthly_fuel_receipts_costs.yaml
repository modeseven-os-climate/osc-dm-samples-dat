  description: 'The core EIA-923 monthly fuel receipts and costs dataset contains
    detailed information on fuel deliveries to power plants as reported in EIA-923
    Schedule 2, Part A. Each record in this dataset represents an individual fuel
    delivery. This data includes important metrics such as the type of fuel delivered,
    the supplier, the receiving plant, and the month of delivery. It is important
    to note that multiple deliveries of the same fuel type from the same supplier
    to the same plant within a single month can occur. Consequently, the table has
    no natural primary key.


    The dataset is particularly useful for understanding the flow and cost of fuel
    to power plants, though it has some limitations. There can be a significant delay
    between the receipt and the consumption of fuel, meaning that using this data
    to determine monthly power generation costs or fuel consumption might not be entirely
    accurate. Despite this, the data is the most granular source available for examining
    fuel costs and is instrumental in calculating the marginal cost of electricity
    for individual generation units.


    In some cases, utilities may classify the price of fuel as proprietary business
    data, resulting in redactions in publicly available spreadsheets. However, this
    redacted information is still reported to the Energy Information Administration
    (EIA) and contributes to aggregated data analyses.'
