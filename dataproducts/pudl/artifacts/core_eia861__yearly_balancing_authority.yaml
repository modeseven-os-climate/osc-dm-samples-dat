  description: The dataset "core_eia861__yearly_balancing_authority" offers an annual
    overview of information pertaining to balancing authorities. Each entry includes
    a report date indicating when the data was recorded, and a balancing authority
    ID assigned by the EIA, which may or may not match the utility ID associated with
    the same entity. Additionally, the dataset provides a unique short code for each
    balancing authority, which can include entities from Canada and Mexico alongside
    those from the United States. The balancing authority name is also included, enabling
    clear identification of each balancing authority. Overall, the dataset contains
    2,360 rows, capturing the annual data across multiple years for various balancing
    authorities, thereby providing a historical perspective of their operational details.
    This can assist in analyses related to energy distribution, regulatory compliance,
    and market operations.
