  description: The Core EIA861 Yearly Demand Side Management dataset contains data
    about the impact of energy efficiency and load management programs on electricity
    consumption and demand. It includes information on total energy sold (measured
    in megawatt-hours, or MWh) and peak demand (measured in megawatts, or MW) categorized
    by customer class. The dataset captures both incremental effects, which are attributed
    to new programs and participants within a year, and total annual effects, accounting
    for all programs and participants in a given year. Additionally, the dataset provides
    potential effects, which represent anticipated peak reductions due to load management
    programs. It also details the cost of demand-side management (DSM) programs and
    the number of customers enrolled in price-responsive and time-responsive programs.
    Notably, the dataset contains information up to 2012 from the raw EIA861 demand-side
    management table, which was later separated into energy efficiency and demand
    response tables due to changes in the reporting format post-2012. Therefore, data
    collected before and after 2012 are not directly comparable and are stored in
    separate tables.
