artifact:
  description: This product contains data detailing different types of steam plants
    as classified in the EIA-860 form. There are four classifications included. The
    first type, labeled "steam_over_100mw," describes plants with combustible-fueled
    steam-electric generators that have a combined nameplate capacity of 100 megawatts
    or more, which includes combined cycle steam-electric generators with duct firing.
    The second classification, "steam_between_10mw_and_100mw," represents plants with
    combustible-fueled steam-electric generators having a capacity between 10 and
    100 megawatts. The dataset gives a thorough insight into the diverse types of
    steam plants, their capacity, and the nature of their fuel sources. This classification
    aids in categorizing and understanding the scale and capacity of different steam
    power generating facilities.
