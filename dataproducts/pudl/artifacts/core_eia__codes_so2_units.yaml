  description: 'This product contains a coding table describing the different units
    of measurement for sulfur dioxide as reported in the EIA-860 database. It includes
    nine rows, each representing a unique code associated with sulfur dioxide measurements.
    The dataset specifies three key attributes for each code: a short code originally
    reported, a longer human-readable label in snake_case, and a detailed description
    explaining the meaning of each code. The data encompasses various types of sulfur
    dioxide measurements such as ambient air quality concentration, emission rates
    in pounds per hour, and concentrations in stack gas. This allows users to understand
    and interpret the different metrics used for reporting sulfur dioxide levels.'
