  description: 'The dataset contains comprehensive information on various types of
    power plants reported in FERC Form 1, including steam, small generators, hydro,
    and pumped storage plants. Each entry includes the year in which the data was
    reported, the utility ID assigned by FERC and PUDL, and the name of the utility
    reporting the data. Additionally, the dataset provides unique plant IDs assigned
    by PUDL and FERC, although these IDs may not be consistent over time or across
    different database instances.


    The name of each plant is recorded as reported to FERC, which is a freeform string
    and may not be uniformly consistent. This dataset allows users to analyze and
    compare power generation data across different plants and utilities over time,
    offering insights into utility operations, plant performance, and trends in the
    energy sector. The data is licensed under a CC-BY-4.0 license, making it accessible
    for various types of analysis and reporting with appropriate attribution.'
