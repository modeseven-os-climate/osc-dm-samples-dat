  description: The EIA-861 Balancing Authority Service Territory dataset provides
    comprehensive county-level data relating to the service territories managed by
    various balancing authorities across the United States. Each entry in the dataset
    includes the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code for the county,
    the county's name as specified in Census DP1 data, and the county's population
    also sourced from Census DP1 data. Additionally, the dataset documents the geographic
    area of each county in square kilometers, the reported date of the data, and the
    unique EIA balancing authority ID, which, while often aligning with utility IDs,
    can differ. The dataset covers all states in the US, using two-letter state abbreviations
    and includes the county name and the state's two-digit FIPS code. This dataset
    is vital for understanding the geographical distribution and demographic characteristics
    of the service territories managed by different balancing authorities, and can
    support a variety of analyses, including regional planning, resource allocation,
    and service quality assessment.
