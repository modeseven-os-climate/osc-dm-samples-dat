  description: The dataset provides monthly estimates of generator capacity factors
    across various power plants. Capacity factor is calculated based on the reported
    generator capacity and the allocated net generation documented in the generation
    and generation fuel tables. Each record in the dataset contains a unique six-digit
    facility identification number (plant_id_eia) assigned by the Energy Information
    Administration, the generator's ID which may be numeric or alphanumeric, the net
    electricity generation for the specified period measured in megawatt-hours (net_generation_mwh),
    and the total installed nameplate capacity measured in megawatts (capacity_mw).
    The data also includes the date on which the information was reported. Note that
    the dataset contains raw values and may include some data points that are illogical
    or out of expected bounds, necessitating filtering for accurate analysis.
