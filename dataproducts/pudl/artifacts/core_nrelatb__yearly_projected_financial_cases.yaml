  description: "The dataset \"core_nrelatb__yearly_projected_financial_cases\" provides\
    \ financial data and assumptions for various electricity generation technologies,\
    \ as projected by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The dataset\
    \ includes information from 2,852 records, covering several years. Each record\
    \ contains data for a specific year, categorized under \"report_year\" and \"\
    projection_year,\" detailing the timeline of the reported and projected financial\
    \ values.\n\nThe dataset incorporates two distinct financial assumption cases\u2014\
    R&D Only Case and Market + Policies Case. The R&D Only Case considers only projected\
    \ research and development improvements, while the Market + Policies Case includes\
    \ policy and tax incentives. These cases significantly influence the financial\
    \ projections and are vital for analyzing future financial scenarios for electricity\
    \ generation technologies.\n\nAdditionally, the dataset provides a \"technology_description\"\
    \ for each data point, offering a high-level explanation of the technology used\
    \ by the generator to produce electricity. \n\nThe \"inflation_rate\" column indicates\
    \ the rate of inflation, ensuring that all dollar values are presented in consistent\
    \ 2021 USD terms. This adjustment uses the Consumer Price Index for All Urban\
    \ Consumers to maintain accuracy across different years' financial projections.\n\
    \nOverall, this dataset is important for stakeholders in the energy sector, financial\
    \ analysts, and policymakers to understand and analyze the financial viability\
    \ and future projections of various electricity generation technologies under\
    \ different scenarios."
