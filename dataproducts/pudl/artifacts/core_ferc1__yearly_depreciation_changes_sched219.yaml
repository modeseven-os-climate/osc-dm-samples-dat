  description: The dataset contains detailed information about the accumulated provision
    for depreciation of electric utility plants, specifically captured under Account
    108. It includes balances and changes documented over the year in Schedule 219
    Section A. The data encompasses various attributes such as PUDL-assigned utility
    IDs, reporting years, types of depreciation provisions (like cost of removal,
    depreciation expenses, salvage, and cost of retired plant), financial status of
    the utility plant (e.g., in service, future, leased, total), and types of utility
    plants (such as Electric Utility, Gas Utility, and Other Utility). The dataset
    also records the dollar values associated with each reported income, expense,
    asset, or liability, along with unique record identifiers for entries from the
    original FERC Form. This information can be essential for analysts and stakeholders
    looking to understand and track the financial depreciation and related changes
    in utility assets over time.
