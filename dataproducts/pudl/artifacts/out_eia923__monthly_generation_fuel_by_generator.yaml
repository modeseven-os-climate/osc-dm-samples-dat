  description: 'The dataset contains detailed information pertaining to monthly estimated
    net generation and fuel consumption by individual generators based on the EIA-923
    generation and generation_fuel tables. Users can find the following data fields
    in the dataset:


    Date reported, which indicates the specific month and year of the data.


    Plant ID, a unique six-digit facility identification number assigned by the Energy
    Information Administration (EIA).


    PUDL plant ID, a manually assigned identifier by PUDL, which may not be consistent
    over time.


    Plant name, the name of the power plant.


    Utility ID, the EIA-assigned Utility Identification number.


    PUDL utility ID, manually assigned by PUDL, which may also vary over time.


    Utility name, the name of the electricity utility company.


    Generator ID, an identifier for the generator that can include numeric or alphanumeric
    characters.


    Unit ID, a dynamically assigned PUDL identifier for the unit.


    This information allows users to track and analyze electricity generation and
    fuel consumption patterns at a granular level, potentially aiding in regulatory
    compliance, operational optimization, and strategic planning.'
