  description: 'The out_ferc1__yearly_retained_earnings_sched118 dataset provides
    detailed information on retained earnings from various utilities as reported in
    FERC Form 1. The data is publicly available under the CC-BY-4.0 license and includes
    the following key fields:


    - PUDL-assigned utility ID (utility_id_ferc1) which uniquely identifies each utility
    within the dataset.

    - A manually assigned PUDL utility ID (utility_id_pudl) which may not be stable
    over time.

    - Utility name (utility_name_ferc1) as reported in FERC Form 1 for human readability.

    - The year of the report (report_year) which is a four-digit number indicating
    when the data was collected.

    - An identifier for the original source record (record_id) which ensures uniqueness
    within the FERC Form 1 database tables.

    - The type of earnings (earnings_type) which provides a label describing the nature
    of the earnings.

    - The account balance at the beginning of the year (starting_balance).

    - The account balance at the end of the year (ending_balance).


    This dataset allows users to track and analyze the financial performance of utilities
    over time, identifying trends and making data-driven decisions based on historical
    retained earnings data.'
