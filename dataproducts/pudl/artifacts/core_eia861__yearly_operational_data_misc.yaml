    exchanges received, exchanges delivered, exchanges net, wheeled received, wheeled
    delivered, wheeled net, transmission by others, and losses. Important variables
    in the dataset detail the amount of electricity consumed by the facility, the
    amount used by the electric utility in its own departments without charge, and
    whether the given values are observed or imputed. Additionally, the dataset indicates
    the entity type of the principal owner and specifics on exchange energy delivered
    and received, excluding any power delivered as part of a tolling arrangement.
    This data is essential for businesses seeking detailed insights into electricity
    sources, usage, and transmission among utilities.
