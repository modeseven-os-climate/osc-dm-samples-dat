  description: 'The dataset from core_epa__assn_eia_epacamd_subplant_ids offers detailed
    information aimed at connecting EPA units with EIA units and generators. It serves
    as an augmented version of the core_epa__assn_eia_epacamd crosswalk table, initially
    sourced from the EPA''s camd-eia-crosswalk repository on GitHub. The primary goal
    is to assist in identifying and connecting various elements of power plants, which
    can often operate as distinct entities under a single plant identification number.
    These subplants represent the smallest coherent units for aggregation, which are
    crucial for detailed analysis.


    The data encompasses several critical components of a power plant: emissions data
    from smokestacks, fuel usage information from combustors, and electricity production
    from generators. Given the intricate, many-to-many relationships between these
    components, the dataset addresses the complexity by providing a structured association,
    enabling accurate attribution of emissions and fuel usage to specific generators.
    This dataset is highly valuable for stakeholders involved in energy production,
    regulatory compliance, and environmental analysis, facilitating comprehensive
    understanding of pollution allocation and energy production activities.'
