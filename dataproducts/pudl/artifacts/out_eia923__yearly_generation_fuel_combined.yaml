  description: 'The EIA-923 Monthly Generation and Fuel Consumption Time Series dataset
    contains detailed information on power generation and fuel consumption by electric
    power plants in the United States. This dataset, part of the EIA-923 report, includes
    combined data from both fossil fuel and nuclear generation sources. Key data elements
    include the report date, unique plant identification numbers (assigned by the
    Energy Information Administration and the PUDL), plant names, utility identification
    numbers, utility names, and various metrics related to power generation and fuel
    consumption.


    This dataset provides comprehensive coverage of the monthly generation details
    for plants, including aggregated nuclear generation data from the unit level to
    the plant prime mover level to ensure consistency with fossil fuel data. It serves
    as a crucial resource for understanding energy production patterns, analyzing
    fuel usage trends, and supporting energy policy and economic analysis. With over
    250,000 rows of data, the dataset offers in-depth insights into the energy sector''s
    operational dynamics and can be instrumental for utilities, policymakers, analysts,
    and researchers.'
