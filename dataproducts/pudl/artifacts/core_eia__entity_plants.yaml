  description: The dataset "core_eia__entity_plants" provides a comprehensive compilation
    of static plant attributes from various sources, including the EIA-860 and EIA-923
    data. It contains 16,847 rows of detailed information about energy plants across
    the United States. For each plant, the dataset includes a unique six-digit facility
    identification number assigned by the Energy Information Administration, also
    known as ORISPL. Additionally, it provides the plant name, city, county, and state
    of location. The dataset offers geographical data such as latitude and longitude
    coordinates, and the physical street address including the zip code. Lastly, it
    includes the IANA timezone name, which specifies the time zone of the plant's
    location. This dataset is valuable for understanding the geographical and administrative
    details of energy plants across the country.
