  description: The dataset "core_ferc1__yearly_transmission_lines_sched422" provides
    a detailed record of transmission line statistics as reported in Schedule 422
    of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Form 1. This data includes
    information on various aspects of transmission lines such as their starting and
    ending points, the operating voltage in kilo-volts for three-phase 60 cycle alternate
    current lines, and associated costs. The records are identified using a unique
    identifier which is formatted based on the table name, report year, report period,
    respondent ID, supplemental number, and row number. Each utility is also assigned
    a unique ID by PUDL, which may change year to year. The dataset spans across multiple
    years with each record corresponding to a specific reporting year. This comprehensive
    collection aids in analyzing the infrastructure, financials, and operational specifics
    of U.S. transmission lines as reported to FERC.
