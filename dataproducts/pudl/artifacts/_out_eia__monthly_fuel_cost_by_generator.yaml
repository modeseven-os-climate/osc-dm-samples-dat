  description: 'This dataset provides monthly estimates of fuel costs for individual
    electricity generators, indexed by date and facility identification number (plant_id_eia).
    The estimates cover both the cost per MMBTU (Million British Thermal Units) and
    per MWh (Megawatt-hour) of generated electricity. These cost calculations are
    derived from plant-level data on fuel prices and consumption, as well as the net
    generation data from each generator, where available.


    The dataset is built through complex intermediary calculations that require the
    unit ID to be filled in, resulting in lower coverage. Fuel costs are aggregated
    into broad fuel categories rather than detailed energy source codes. Users should
    note that the data includes some unfiltered and potentially unreasonable values
    that would require additional filtering for practical use. This dataset is valuable
    for analyzing cost trends, fuel consumption efficiency, and operational costs
    of power generation facilities, but requires careful handling to ensure data accuracy
    and validity.'
