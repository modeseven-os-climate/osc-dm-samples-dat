  description: 'The core_eia__codes_storage_enclosure_types dataset is a coding table
    specifically designed for categorizing types of energy storage enclosures. It
    contains information for four different codes, each representing a distinct type
    of enclosure used in energy storage systems. The dataset includes three main columns:
    ''code'', ''label'', and ''description''. The ''code'' column contains originally
    reported short codes, which are concise identifiers for each enclosure type. The
    ''label'' column provides longer, human-readable codes in snake_case format that
    are more descriptive. The ''description'' column offers a detailed, human-readable
    explanation of what each code and label represent. The four types of enclosures
    coded in the dataset include buildings (BL), containerized stationary enclosures
    (CS), containerized transportable enclosures (CT), and other miscellaneous types
    (OT). This dataset is useful for understanding and standardizing the various types
    of storage enclosures used across energy storage systems.'
