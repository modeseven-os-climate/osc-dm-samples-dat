  description: Our product provides a comprehensive database extracted from the Federal
    Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Form 1, specifically focusing on annual depreciation
    and amortization information reported by utility companies. The dataset includes
    detailed records spanning multiple years and covers various utility plant functions
    such as steam production, nuclear production, distribution, and transmission.
    Each record in the database is uniquely identifiable and includes key attributes
    such as the year of the report, utility IDs (both FERC-assigned and PUDL-assigned),
    and the name of the responding utility. This rich dataset enables users to analyze
    yearly trends in depreciation across different utilities and plant functions,
    offering valuable insights for financial analysis, regulatory compliance, and
    strategic planning within the energy sector.
