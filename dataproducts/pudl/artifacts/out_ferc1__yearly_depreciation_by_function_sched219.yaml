  description: "The dataset \"out_ferc1__yearly_depreciation_by_function_sched219\"\
    \ contains detailed records of the accumulated provision for depreciation of electric\
    \ utility plant, as reported in FERC Form 1, Schedule 219 Section B. It includes\
    \ 143,312 rows of data and is licensed under CC-BY-4.0. \n\nEach record in the\
    \ dataset provides the following information:\n- A PUDL-assigned utility ID (utility_id_ferc1),\
    \ which is an auto-incremented identifier unique to each FERC1 utility and may\
    \ change from year to year.\n- A manually assigned PUDL utility ID (utility_id_pudl)\
    \ that may not be stable over time.\n- The name of the utility (utility_name_ferc1)\
    \ as reported in FERC Form 1, intended for human readability.\n- The year (report_year)\
    \ in which the data was reported, formatted as a four-digit year.\n- The type\
    \ of depreciation provision (depreciation_type) within FERC Account 108, which\
    \ encompasses various categories such as cost of removal, depreciation expenses,\
    \ salvage, and cost of retired plant.\n- The functional role (plant_function)\
    \ of the utility plant, for example, steam production, nuclear production, or\
    \ distribution.\n\nThis dataset is useful for analyzing the financial depreciation\
    \ and functional classification of electric utility plants, providing a comprehensive\
    \ view of depreciation provisions over various years and across different utilities."
