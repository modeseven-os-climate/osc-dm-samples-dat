  description: The dataset "core_eia861__yearly_distribution_systems" provides detailed
    information on the number of distribution circuits and circuits with voltage optimization
    across various states in the United States. Key data fields include the total
    number of distribution circuits and the number of these circuits that employ voltage/VAR
    optimization (VVO). The dataset also includes metadata such as the report date,
    indicating when the information was reported, and a flag indicating whether the
    data comes from the shorter version of the EIA 861 form, designed to reduce the
    reporting burden on smaller utilities. Additionally, the dataset specifies the
    state using standard two-letter abbreviations and includes the EIA Utility Identification
    number and the name of the utility, providing a clear linkage to the reporting
    entity. Lastly, an indicator of data maturity specifies the reliability and completeness
    of the data record, signaling whether some data entries might be less-than-final.
    This dataset is valuable for analyzing the adoption of voltage optimization technologies
    in utility distribution systems, comparing infrastructure across states, and understanding
    utility-level details of distribution networks.
