  description: The core_eia861__yearly_demand_side_management_sales dataset provides
    a comprehensive overview of electricity sales in the United States, with records
    spanning from before 2012. The dataset captures various aspects of electricity
    distribution, specifically focusing on demand-side management. Key data points
    include the amount of electricity sold for resale purposes, covering transactions
    to power marketers, full and partial requirements customers, as well as firm and
    nonfirm customers. Each record is associated with a date of reporting and indicates
    the NERC region where the plant is located. It is important to note that after
    2012, data collection practices changed, splitting the information into separate
    tables for energy efficiency and demand response, making the pre- and post-2012
    data noncomparable. The information is vital for understanding trends in electricity
    sales and distribution across different regions and can aid in market analysis
    and strategic planning for the electricity supply industry. The dataset is licensed
    under CC-BY-4.0, allowing for wide usage and sharing.
