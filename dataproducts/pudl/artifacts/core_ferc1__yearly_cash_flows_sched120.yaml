  description: The core FERC1 yearly cash flows schedule 120 dataset provides detailed
    information on cash flow data reported by utilities in their FERC Form 1 filings.
    It contains 294,297 rows of structured financial data, with each record uniquely
    identified by a specific format that includes the table name, report year, report
    period, respondent ID, supplement number, and row number. The dataset includes
    the report year, a PUDL-assigned utility ID for identifying FERC1 utilities, and
    labels describing the type of amount being reported, which could be either a balance
    or a change in value. Additionally, the dataset includes the monetary amount reported,
    indicating whether it is a credit or debit, as well as data classifications such
    as whether the reported value is a balance or change in value, based on the XBRL
    taxonomy. This dataset is licensed under CC-BY-4.0, meaning it is available for
    use with appropriate attribution.
