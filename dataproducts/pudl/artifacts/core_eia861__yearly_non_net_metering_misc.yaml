  description: 'The dataset contains information related to utility or customer-owned
    distributed generation (DG) as reported in the EIA861 Non-Net Metering table.
    This data includes several key metrics: the total nameplate capacity of generators
    used solely for emergency backup service (backup capacity), the short code identifying
    a balancing authority which may include Canadian and Mexican authorities, the
    total number of generators, the current flow type for photovoltaics (either AC
    or DC), and the date of the report. The dataset captures detailed capacity information
    split by sector, including fuel cell data and adjustments of reported capacities
    from DC to AC units. The data available spans from the year 2016 onwards, providing
    insights into non-net metered distributed generation activity, which has been
    isolated to prevent double counting within the dataset.'
