    # Indicator: IMGR_FCO2: Foreign CO2 emissions embodied in gross imports

    OECD Indicators on Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions embodied in international trade
    (TeCO2) are derived by combining the 2021 editions of OECD Inter-Country Input-Output
    (ICIO) Database and of International Energy Agency (IEA) statistics on CO2 emissions
    from fuel combustion. In this release of TeCO2, emissions from fuels used for
    international aviation and maritime transport (i.e. aviation and marine bunkers)
    are also considered.


    ## Industry D35: Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply

    Foreign CO2 emissions embodied in gross imports captures the foreign CO2 emissions
    embodied in gross imports of country/region c with origin in exporting industry
    i in exporting country/region partner p. Note: Regions are treated as a unit,
    i.e. IMGR_FCO2 excludes intra-regional trade, as so, intra-region flows are considered
    as domestic.


    ## Industry: DTOTAL: TOTAL

    Foreign CO2 emissions embodied in gross imports captures the foreign CO2 emissions
    embodied in gross imports of country/region c with origin in exporting industry
    i in exporting country/region partner p. Note: Regions are treated as a unit,
    i.e. IMGR_FCO2 excludes intra-regional trade, as so, intra-region flows are considered
    as domestic.


    # Indicator: EXGR_DCO2: Foreign CO2 emissions embodied in gross imports

    OECD Indicators on Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions embodied in international trade
    (TeCO2) are derived by combining the 2021 editions of OECD Inter-Country Input-Output
    (ICIO) Database and of International Energy Agency (IEA) statistics on CO2 emissions
    from fuel combustion. In this release of TeCO2, emissions from fuels used for
    international aviation and maritime transport (i.e. aviation and marine bunkers)
    are also considered.


    ## Industry: DTOTAL:TOTAL

    EXGR_DCO2c,p,i, Domestic CO2 emissions embodied in gross exports, by industry
    i in country / region c to partner country/region p, represents the embodied CO2
    emissions in exports that has been generated anywhere in the domestic economy
    (i.e. not just by the exporting industry). Note: Regions are treated as a unit,
    i.e., EXGR_DCO2 excludes intra-regional trade, as so, intra-region flows are considered
    as domestic.'
