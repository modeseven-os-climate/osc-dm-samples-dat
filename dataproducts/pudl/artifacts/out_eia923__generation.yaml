  description: The dataset provides detailed records of monthly net electricity generation
    from individual reporting generators. It contains granular information on the
    amount of electricity generated on a monthly basis, which is the most detailed
    level of generation data available. However, it is important to note that this
    table only includes about half of the total generation reported, as different
    types and sizes of generators have varying reporting requirements. The information
    from this dataset is crucial for estimating heat rates and the marginal cost of
    electricity on a per-generator basis, although these calculations depend on plant-level
    fuel costs and sometimes incomplete boiler-generator associations. Additionally,
    a small number of respondents report their net generation annually, with data
    consolidated in December. This dataset provides valuable insights for energy analysis,
    operational planning, and cost estimation in the electricity generation industry.
