  description: 'The dataset includes a comprehensive collection of information about
    energy generators from the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Each generator
    in the dataset is uniquely identified by a six-digit plant ID, which is also referred
    to as an ORISPL. The dataset provides detailed records on each generator''s attributes,
    including its generator ID, report date, plant name, utility name, and descriptions
    of the generator technology used.


    Additionally, it contains dynamically assigned PUDL unit and plant IDs, though
    these may change over time as updates to the data and algorithms occur. The dataset
    also includes manually assigned utility IDs and names, which are not necessarily
    stable over time.


    In essence, this dataset is useful for understanding the inventory and characteristics
    of energy generators, tracking changes and developments over the years, and identifying
    the various utilities and plants operating within the energy sector. The data
    provides insights into the scope and technological makeup of energy generation,
    facilitating analysis and reporting for various stakeholders in the energy industry.'
