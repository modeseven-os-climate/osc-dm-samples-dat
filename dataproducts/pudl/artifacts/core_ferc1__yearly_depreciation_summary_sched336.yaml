  description: The dataset provides a comprehensive summary of depreciation and amortization
    changes for electric plant assets, as reported in FERC Form 1, Schedule 336a.
    It includes over 210,000 rows of data, detailing annual reports from utility companies.
    Each record is uniquely identified by a combination of table name, report year,
    reporting period, respondent ID, supplement number, and row number. Key data fields
    include the report year, a unique utility ID assigned by the Public Utility Data
    Liberation (PUDL) project, the functional role of the utility plant (such as steam
    production, nuclear production, distribution, or transmission), and detailed FERC
    account labels derived from reported values in the XBRL taxonomies. This dataset
    allows users to analyze changes in depreciation and amortization for different
    types of utility plant functions, aiding in financial analysis, auditing, and
    regulatory compliance.
