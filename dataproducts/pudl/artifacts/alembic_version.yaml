  description: The database for the high-level business product includes an "alembic_version"
    table. This table contains a single version_num column which holds version numbers
    of the database schema. The version_num column is the primary key, ensuring that
    each version is uniquely identifiable. For instance, the record in the table shows
    a version number "6dcb5e3e07dd." This data helps in tracking and managing different
    schema versions of the database, crucial for maintaining consistency, implementing
    updates, and reversing changes if necessary. This setup is essential for businesses
    that need reliable version control and database management to ensure seamless
    operations and data integrity.
