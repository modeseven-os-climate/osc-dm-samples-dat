  description: The PUDL core database integrates a variety of datasets that are essential
    for energy industry analysis and environmental research. The data sources encompassed
    within PUDL include detailed information from several critical categories, such
    as utility operations, plant characteristics, fuel purchases, emissions, and grid
    connectivity. Each datasource is identified by a unique code and includes corresponding
    data partitions, which are typically delineated by year or other relevant temporal
    markers. Users can find comprehensive datasets such as the EIA-860, which provides
    annual data on electric power plants, their capacities, and generator-specific
    details. Additionally, the database includes digital object identifiers (DOIs)
    for referencing specific versions of datasets archived on Zenodo, ensuring proper
    citation and version tracking. Finally, each entry notes the specific version
    of the PUDL software used to compile the data, ensuring transparency and reproducibility
    of the datasets provided. This structure allows analysts to easily locate, reference,
    and utilize accurate and up-to-date information pertinent to the energy sector.
