  description: This data product contains detailed monthly attributes of electric
    generators in the United States. It includes information on generator capacity
    factor, heat rate, fuel cost per MMBTU, and fuel cost per MWh. These calculations
    are derived from the net generation data reported at the plant level, which is
    further broken down by the type of prime mover and energy source used. The heat
    rates for each generator on a monthly basis are estimated using the allocated
    net generation and fuel consumption data, in addition to monthly boiler fuel data
    from EIA-923 reports. Heat rate data is crucial for estimating the fuel consumption
    of each generation unit, which in turn helps calculate the fuel cost per MWh generated.
    The dataset also includes plant-specific fuel prices, but it is important to note
    that the fuel cost estimates cover approximately 70% of the data due to the availability
    of fuel receipts and costs data. Overall, this dataset provides comprehensive
    insights into the operational efficiency and cost structure of electricity generators
    in the US on a monthly basis.
