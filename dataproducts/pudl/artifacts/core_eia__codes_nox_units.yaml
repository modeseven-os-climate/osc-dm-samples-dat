  description: The dataset contains information on different units of measurement
    for nitrogen oxides as reported in the EIA-860. It includes six rows, each specifying
    a unique code, a longer human-readable label, and a description explaining the
    meaning of the code. The data provides measurements such as pounds of nitrogen
    oxides emitted per hour, parts per million of nitrogen oxides in stack gas, and
    ambient air quality concentration of nitrogen oxides. It also includes codes for
    declining levels of annual nitrogen oxides emissions. This dataset can be useful
    for monitoring and analyzing nitrogen oxides emissions across various parameters
    and ensuring that reporting aligns with standardized units.
