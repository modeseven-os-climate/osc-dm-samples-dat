  description: The dataset provides detailed information about flue gas desulfurization
    (FGD) equipment at generation facilities, derived from the EIA-860 Schedule 6E.
    This includes a unique six-digit facility identification number known as ORISPL,
    assigned by the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Each sulfur dioxide control
    equipment is associated with a specific identification number, though this ID
    is not unique across the dataset. Information is also provided about each utility,
    including their EIA Utility Identification number and name. The dataset specifies
    the location of each facility, including the state (with both two-letter abbreviations
    and two-digit FIPS codes), county (with corresponding county FIPS codes), along
    with the date the data was reported. This data can be used for a comprehensive
    understanding of sulfur dioxide control implementations across various utilities
    and locations.
