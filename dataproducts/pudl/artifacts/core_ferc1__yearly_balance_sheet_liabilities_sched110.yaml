  description: 'The dataset comprises detailed information from the Federal Energy
    Regulatory Commission''s (FERC) Form 1, focusing on the yearly balance sheets
    of utilities, specifically their liabilities and other credits. Each record includes
    a unique identifier for the original FERC Form 1 source record, indicating details
    such as table name, report year, reporting period, respondent ID, supplement number,
    and row number. The records span multiple years, with a four-digit year indicating
    the specific year of reporting. Each utility is identified by a PUDL-assigned
    utility ID for consistency and tracking purposes.


    The data set captures the balance of various liability accounts at the beginning
    and end of the year. These balances are categorized by the type of liability being
    reported, such as long-term debt, accounts payable, or other liabilities. Additionally,
    the dataset specifies whether the amounts are reported as credits or debits, aligning
    with the XBRL taxonomy for accurate financial reporting.


    Overall, this dataset is valuable for analyzing the financial health and liabilities
    of utilities over time, providing insights into their debt levels, changes in
    financial obligations, and overall fiscal management.'
