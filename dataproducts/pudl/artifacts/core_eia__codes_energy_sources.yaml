  description: 'This dataset provides comprehensive details about energy sources reported
    to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). It includes 42 rows of data,
    each representing different energy sources with the following key attributes:


    1. Code: A short code originally reported to EIA, representing each energy source.

    2. Label: A longer, human-readable code using a standardized snake_case format
    for clarity.

    3. Fuel Units: The reported unit of measure for each type of fuel.

    4. Minimum and Maximum Fuel Content: Both the minimum and maximum heat content
    per physical unit of the fuel, measured in MMBtu (million British thermal units).

    5. Fuel Group: High-level fuel grouping as defined in the EIA Form 860 instructions,
    helping to categorize the types of energy resources.

    6. Fuel Derived From: Information indicating the original fuel from which the
    given refined fuel was derived.

    7. Fuel Phase: The physical phase of matter (solid, liquid, or gas) of the fuel.

    8. Fuel Type Code: A simplified fuel type code used within the PUDL system for
    easier analysis and categorization.

    9. Description: A long, human-readable explanation providing more detail about
    what each code or label represents.


    This dataset aims to offer essential metadata about energy sources to support
    reporting, analysis, and decision-making processes in the energy sector. It facilitates
    understanding of different fuel types, their properties, and relationships, thereby
    enhancing data-driven insights and strategic planning.'
