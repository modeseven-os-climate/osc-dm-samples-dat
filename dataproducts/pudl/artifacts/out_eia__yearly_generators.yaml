  description: The dataset "out_eia__yearly_generators" provides comprehensive information
    about generator attributes on an annual basis. It includes details such as the
    unique identification numbers for facilities (plant_id_eia) and generators (generator_id),
    the date of report submission (report_date), and the dynamically assigned PUDL
    unit ID (unit_id_pudl). Furthermore, it includes manually assigned PUDL plant
    and utility IDs (plant_id_pudl and utility_id_pudl), which may vary over time.
    The dataset also captures the plant name (plant_name_eia), the utility identification
    number assigned by the EIA (utility_id_eia), and the name of the utility (utility_name_eia).
    Additionally, it provides descriptions related to the technology used (technology_description).
    This dataset is crucial for analyzing various attributes of power generators,
    including their capacity, efficiency, and fuel costs, and can be used for in-depth
    analysis and decision-making in the energy sector.
