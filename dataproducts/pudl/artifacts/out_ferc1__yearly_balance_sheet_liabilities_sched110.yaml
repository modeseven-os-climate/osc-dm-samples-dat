  description: The dataset provides detailed information on the yearly balance sheet
    liabilities for utilities as reported in the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
    (FERC) Form 1. It contains 219,964 rows of data covering multiple years. Each
    record includes a unique identifier indicating its original FERC Form 1 source,
    the reporting year, and the utility's corresponding IDs assigned by both FERC
    and PUDL. It also includes the name of the utility as reported in FERC Form 1
    for human readability. For each utility, the dataset captures the account balance
    at the beginning and end of the year, along with the type of liability being reported.
    This information allows for the analysis of financial changes in liabilities over
    time for various utilities.
