  description: "The dataset \"core_eia861__yearly_utility_data_nerc\" contains information\
    \ about the operations of utilities within various NERC (North American Electric\
    \ Reliability Corporation) regions. The dataset is comprised of 35,843 rows and\
    \ includes the following data fields: \n\n- `nerc_region`: The specific NERC region\
    \ where the plant is located.\n- `nerc_regions_of_operation`: All the NERC regional\
    \ entities where the utility conducts operations.\n- `report_date`: The date when\
    \ the data was reported.\n- `state`: The two-letter abbreviation for the US state\
    \ where the utility operates.\n- `utility_id_eia`: The unique identification number\
    \ assigned to each utility by the Energy Information Administration (EIA).\n-\
    \ `data_maturity`: Indicates the maturity level of the data record, reflecting\
    \ whether it is final or subject to changes. \n\nThis data can be used to analyze\
    \ the geographical and regional operations of electricity utilities, understand\
    \ the distribution of utilities across different NERC regions, and assess the\
    \ temporal aspects of utility reporting and data maturity. The dataset can support\
    \ various analytical tasks, such as regional energy reliability assessments, utility\
    \ performance tracking, and compliance monitoring within the NERC framework."
