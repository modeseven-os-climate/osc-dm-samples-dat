  description: The dataset provides coding information related to the reporting frequencies
    of data from plants in the EIA-923. It includes a short code, a longer human-readable
    label in snake_case, and a detailed description of what each code signifies. Specifically,
    the dataset contains codes that describe whether the data is reported annually
    (A), and explains that for annual reports, any monthly data is estimated based
    on the respondent's annual totals and similar plant characteristics. This coding
    system helps categorize and understand the frequency and method through which
    data is reported by the respondents in the energy sector.
