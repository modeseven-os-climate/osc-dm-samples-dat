  description: 'The dataset contains detailed information on generator ownership as
    reported in the EIA-860 Schedule 4, specifically focusing on jointly or third-party
    owned generators. Key data points include the report date, allowing for historical
    tracking of ownership changes. Each entry provides the unique EIA utility identification
    number for the company responsible for day-to-day operations and the six-digit
    plant identification number assigned by the Energy Information Administration.
    The generator ID, which can be numeric or alphanumeric, is also included to uniquely
    identify each generator.


    The dataset encompasses comprehensive details about the owner utility such as
    the name, state code, city, country code, street address, and zip code, which
    allow for precise localization and identification of the owning entity. Additionally,
    it specifies the fraction of the generator owned by each entity, facilitating
    an understanding of shared ownership structures.


    This detailed ownership information is crucial for stakeholders who need to analyze
    and understand the landscape of generator ownership, track changes over time,
    and assess the responsibilities and geographic distribution of various utility
    companies involved in power generation.'
