  description: This dataset contains comprehensive statistics on various categories
    of power plants in the United States, including steam plants with a capacity of
    25 MW or more, internal combustion and gas-turbine plants with a capacity of 10
    MW or more, and all nuclear plants. The data is reported in Schedule 402 of FERC
    Form 1, which has been extracted from the f1_gnrt_plant table in FERC's Visual
    FoxPro Database. Each record includes an identifier indicating the original source
    of the FERC Form 1 record, along with a PUDL-assigned utility ID to identify the
    FERC1 utility. The dataset captures the four-digit year of the report and features
    the plant name as reported to FERC. This dataset, consisting of 31,879 rows, provides
    critical insights into the operational aspects, capacity, and performance metrics
    of large-scale power generation facilities. The data is licensed under CC-BY-4.0,
    allowing for broad usage with appropriate attribution.
