  description: 'This product contains a detailed coding table that describes various
    flue gas desulfurization sorbent types used in the EIA-860. It includes 23 distinct
    rows, each representing a different sorbent type. The table provides three main
    columns for each entry: a short code (originally reported), a longer human-readable
    code formatted in snake_case, and a comprehensive description explaining the meaning
    and context of each code. The sorbent types listed range from common compounds
    like ammonia and dolomitic limestone to more specific mixtures such as calcium
    carbide slurry and caustic sodium hydroxide. The data is licensed under CC-BY-4.0,
    ensuring it is available for public use with appropriate attribution. This dataset
    is valuable for understanding the specific materials used in flue gas desulfurization
    processes within energy production facilities.'
