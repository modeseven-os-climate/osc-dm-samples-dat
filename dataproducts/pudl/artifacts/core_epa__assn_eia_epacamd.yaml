  description: The core_epa__assn_eia_epacamd data product integrates information
    from the EPA and EIA to assist in mapping EPA units to EIA plants, boilers, and
    generators. It is based on data from 2018 and currently contains 12,832 rows.
    This crosswalk table, sourced from the EPA's camd-eia-crosswalk repository, is
    crucial for connecting and comparing emissions data and generation data between
    the two agencies. The table has been cleaned up by adapting some column names
    and removing unmatched rows to enhance usability. Future developments aim to provide
    a temporal version for more accurate tracking of plant changes over time. This
    data product helps in understanding the complex relationships and differences
    in granularity between EPA's and EIA's units.
