  description: The core_eia861__yearly_distributed_generation_tech dataset provides
    detailed information on the technology used for utility or customer-owned distributed
    generation. It includes data on the total installed nameplate capacity in megawatts
    of these distributed generation systems. Each entry specifies whether the technology
    data reported is estimated or actual, giving users insight into the reliability
    of the data. The dataset covers diverse types of distributed generation technologies,
    such as backup, combined heat and power (cogeneration), combustion turbines, fuel
    cells, and hydro technologies, among others. Additionally, it records the report
    dates and the two-letter US state abbreviations where the data was collected,
    allowing for temporal and geographical analysis. This dataset is useful for understanding
    the landscape and evolution of distributed generation technologies across different
    states and over time, aiding businesses and policymakers in making informed energy-related
    decisions.
