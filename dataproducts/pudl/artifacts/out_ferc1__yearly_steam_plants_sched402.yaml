  description: The FERC Form 1 Steam Plant Data encompasses detailed information on
    steam plants reported by utilities each year. It includes data points such as
    the year in which the data was reported, utility identifiers both from FERC and
    a PUDL-assigned ID, and the name of the responding utility. It also provides identifiers
    and names for the plants, including manually assigned PUDL plant IDs and algorithmically
    assigned FERC Plant IDs. The plant names are as reported to FERC and are freeform
    strings. Additionally, the table contains data on asset retirement costs among
    other specifics related to steam plant operations. This dataset allows for comprehensive
    analysis and comparison of steam plant operations across different utilities and
    years, providing valuable insights into trends, plant performances, and utility
    management practices.
