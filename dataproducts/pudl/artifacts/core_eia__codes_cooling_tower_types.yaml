  description: 'The dataset comprises a coding table specifically designed for cooling
    tower types, providing a detailed classification of various cooling tower processes
    used in energy facilities. It includes six distinct rows, each representing different
    cooling tower configurations. For each type, the dataset lists three key attributes:
    a short code, a longer human-readable label in snake_case, and a comprehensive
    description detailing the specific cooling process.


    The short code serves as an identifier, whereas the human-readable label offers
    a clear and concise representation of the cooling tower type for ease of understanding.
    The descriptions provide in-depth explanations about each type, ensuring clarity
    on the functional differences among them.


    The dataset specifies the following cooling tower types:

    1. Mechanical draft, dry process (mechanical_dry)

    2. Mechanical draft, wet process (mechanical_wet)

    3. Natural draft, dry process (natural_dry)

    4. Natural draft, wet process (natural_wet)

    5. Combination of wet and dry processes (combo_wet_dry)

    6. Other types that do not fall into the above categories (other)


    This dataset is valuable for organizations involved in energy production and management,
    as it enables a standardized understanding and classification of cooling tower
    technologies.'
