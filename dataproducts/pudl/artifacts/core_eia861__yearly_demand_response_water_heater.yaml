    information on the number of grid-connected water heaters enrolled in demand response
    programs across various utilities and states in the United States. It includes
    4,153 rows of data with the following columns:


    1. **balancing_authority_code_eia**: This is the EIA short code that identifies
    the balancing authority, which may also include Canadian and Mexican Balancing
    Authorities.

    2. **report_date**: The date the information was reported.

    3. **state**: The two-letter abbreviation of the US state where the utility is
    located.

    4. **utility_id_eia**: The unique identification number assigned to each utility
    by the Energy Information Administration (EIA).

    5. **water_heater**: The number of grid-enabled water heaters added to the demand
    response program by the respondent utility for that year.

    6. **data_maturity**: The level of maturity of the data record, indicating if
    the data is final or preliminary.


    This dataset is useful for analyzing the adoption and geographic distribution
    of demand response programs specifically tailored to water heaters. It can help
    in identifying trends, the effectiveness of these programs, and the involvement
    of different utilities and states in such initiatives.'
