  description: 'Our business product provides granular accounting data typically included
    in utility rate bases, derived from seven FERC Form 1 accounting tables with nested
    calculations. The product reconciles these nested calculations to deliver the
    most granular data across various tables.


    Key data points include:

    - Adjusted columns for utility type, plant function, and plant status to provide
    more specificity and condense similar categories for easier analysis. For instance,
    some "total" utility types are converted into "electric," and categories like
    "hydraulic_production" combine "hydraulic_production_conventional" and "hydraulic_production_pumped_storage."

    - Details about utility assets and expenses that are factored into rate bases,
    thus allowing for accurate financial analysis and planning.

    - Structured data that makes it easier for businesses and analysts to conduct
    thorough evaluations and comparisons of utility financial performance.


    This comprehensive dataset supports enhanced financial oversight and strategic
    decision-making for stakeholders in the utility sector.'
