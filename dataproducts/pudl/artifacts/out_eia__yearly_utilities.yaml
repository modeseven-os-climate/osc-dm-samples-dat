    of a comprehensive denormalized table containing a wide array of utility attributes.
    It includes 146,776 rows of data, focusing on various aspects of U.S. utility
    companies as reported yearly. Key data points featured in this table are:


    - Utility Identification Numbers: Both EIA and PUDL IDs, which uniquely identify
    each utility company. The EIA Utility Identification number is directly from EIA,
    while the PUDL ID is manually assigned and may change over time.

    - Utility Name: The official name of the utility as reported.

    - Reporting Date: The specific date or year the information was reported.

    - Contact Information: This includes street address, city, state (in two-letter
    abbreviation), and five-digit ZIP code of the utility''s physical location.

    - Plant Ownership and Operational Roles: Attributes which indicate whether the
    reporting entity is an owner, operator, asset manager, or has any other relationship
    with the power plants reported on Schedule 2 of the form.


    Overall, this dataset provides a vast amount of detailed, yearly information about
    the operational and ownership statuses of U.S. utility companies, along with their
    basic identification and contact details.'
