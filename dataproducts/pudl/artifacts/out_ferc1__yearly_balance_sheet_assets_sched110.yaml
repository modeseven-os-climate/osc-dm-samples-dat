  description: 'The dataset "out_ferc1__yearly_balance_sheet_assets_sched110" provides
    comprehensive information about the balance sheet assets of various utilities
    as reported in the FERC Form 1. It includes the year in which the data was reported,
    identified by a four-digit format. Each utility is uniquely identified through
    both a PUDL-assigned utility ID, which is auto-incremented and may change over
    time, and a manually assigned PUDL utility ID, which is intended for stable identification.
    The responding utility''s name is captured as reported in FERC Form 1 for human
    readability.


    Additionally, there is a unique record identifier that indicates the origin of
    each FERC Form 1 source record, formatted to include relevant details such as
    table name, report year, reporting period, respondent ID, supplemental number,
    and row number. This ensures each record is distinct within the non-row-mapped
    tables of the FERC Form 1 database. The type of asset being reported in the dataset
    is specified for better understanding and classification. The balance information
    indicates the financial value or worth of these assets as reported.'
