  description: The EIA-923 Monthly Boiler Fuel Consumption and Emissions dataset contains
    detailed information on fuel consumption for boilers on a monthly basis. It includes
    the type and quantity of fuel consumed, measured in standard EIA fuel units such
    as tons, barrels, and Mcf (thousand cubic feet). Additionally, the dataset provides
    the sulfur and ash content of each fuel type and the heat content per unit of
    fuel, which is valuable for calculating the thermal efficiency (heat rate) of
    different generation units. Although this table offers comprehensive coverage
    of the entire fleet of generators, it does not directly link fuel consumption
    to specific generators, presenting a challenge for precise heat rate calculations
    due to the complex and incomplete associations between boilers and generators.
    Note that some respondents report annual fuel consumption data, which is aggregated
    and reported in December.
