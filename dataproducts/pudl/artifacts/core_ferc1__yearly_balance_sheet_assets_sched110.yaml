  description: 'The provided dataset is the Comparative Balance Sheet (Assets and
    Other Debits), Schedule 110, from the FERC Form 1 database. This dataset includes
    information on the yearly financial balance sheets of various utilities, detailing
    their assets and other debits. Each record contains multiple fields including
    a PUDL-assigned utility ID, which uniquely identifies each utility in the dataset;
    the report year, indicating the year in which the data was recorded; and the utility
    type, specifying whether the utility deals with electric, gas, or other types
    of utility services.


    Additionally, the dataset features a record ID, a unique identifier for each original
    FERC Form 1 source record. The asset type field describes the type of asset reported,
    such as cash, accounts receivable, or property. The ending balance and starting
    balance fields provide the account balances at the end and beginning of the reporting
    year, respectively, allowing for analysis of financial changes over the period.
    This comprehensive dataset allows for detailed financial analysis and comparison
    of utilities over time, making it valuable for studies on financial health and
    performance in the utility sector.'
