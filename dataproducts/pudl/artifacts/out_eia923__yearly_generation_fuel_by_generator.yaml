  description: The dataset contains yearly estimated net generation and fuel consumption
    data by individual generators from the EIA-923 reports. It includes detailed information
    such as the report date, unique plant identification numbers assigned both by
    the Energy Information Administration (EIA) and a manually assigned PUDL ID, as
    well as the plant name. Each record also contains the utility identification numbers
    from both the EIA and PUDL, along with the corresponding utility names. Additionally,
    the dataset provides generator IDs, which may consist of numeric or alphanumeric
    characters, and unit IDs assigned by PUDL. This comprehensive dataset allows for
    an in-depth analysis of electricity generation and fuel use at the generator level,
    providing valuable insights into the performance and operations of individual
    power plants and utilities across different reporting years.
