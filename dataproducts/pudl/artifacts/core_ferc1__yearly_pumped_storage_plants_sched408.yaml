  description: 'The dataset contains detailed statistics for hydroelectric pumped
    storage plants with an installed nameplate capacity of 10 megawatts or more, as
    reported in Schedule 408 of the FERC Form 1. The data, extracted from the Visual
    FoxPro database maintained by FERC, is license under CC-BY-4.0.


    Key data points include:

    - Record Identifier: A unique identifier for each record, formatted with details
    about the original FERC Form 1 source record.

    - Utility ID: A PUDL-assigned identifier for the utility reporting the data, which
    is auto-incremented and not stable across years.

    - Report Year: The four-digit year when the data was reported.

    - Plant Name: The name of the pumped storage plant as reported to FERC, which
    is a freeform string and may vary in format for the same plant across different
    records.

    - Installed Nameplate Capacity: Specifies the maximum output of the plant, which
    helps identify plants with a capacity of 10 MW or higher.


    This dataset is valuable for stakeholders interested in the performance and specifications
    of large-scale hydroelectric pumped storage plants in the US, including researchers,
    policy analysts, and industry professionals.'
