    equipment reported to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). It includes
    detailed data on the cost, type, operating status, retirement date, and install
    year of emissions control equipment used in power plants. The data covers control
    equipment for pollutants such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter, mercury,
    nitrogen oxides (NOX), and acid gases like hydrogen chloride (HCl). Each record
    contains specific identifiers and metadata, including the four-digit year of reporting,
    the unique six-digit plant identification number (ORISPL), and a manually assigned
    PUDL plant ID, which may vary over time. Additionally, the data set includes the
    plant name, utility ID, utility name, and other relevant identifiers. This product
    delivers a consolidated source of emissions control equipment data, facilitating
    analysis and understanding of pollution control measures across various power
    plants.
