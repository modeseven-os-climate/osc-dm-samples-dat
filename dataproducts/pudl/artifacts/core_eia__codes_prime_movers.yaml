  description: The database contains comprehensive information on the various prime
    mover codes reported in the EIA-860 and EIA-923 forms, which are used to track
    and analyze energy sources and generation technologies. It includes 24 rows detailing
    prime mover types with their short codes, longer human-readable labels, and thorough
    descriptions explaining their meanings. For example, the code "BA" corresponds
    to "battery_storage," which is described as energy storage using batteries. Other
    entries include "BT" for binary_cycle_turbine, describing turbines used in binary
    cycles, typically for geothermal applications, and "CC" for combined_cycle_total,
    representing the combined-cycle total unit. This dataset is valuable for understanding
    the different types of energy generation technology and their classifications
    in the energy industry.
