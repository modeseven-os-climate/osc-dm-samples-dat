  description: 'The dataset "Annual Electricity Sales to Ultimate Customers" from
    the core_eia861__yearly_sales collection offers detailed information about electricity
    sales across the United States, broken down by utility, balancing authority, state,
    and customer class on an annual basis. It includes 360,660 rows of data, providing
    insights such as the EIA Utility Identification number, the two-letter state abbreviation,
    the report date, and the EIA short code identifying a balancing authority, which
    can include codes from Canada and Mexico as well.


    The data includes categorizations of customer types such as commercial, industrial,
    direct connection, other, residential, total, transportation, and commercial other.
    Information about the business model of the utility and whether the data is observed
    or imputed is also included. Additionally, the dataset details the entity type
    of the principal owner and the type of service the respondent provides to each
    customer class, distinguishing between services that bundle both energy and delivery,
    or just energy. This dataset is valuable for analyzing electricity sales trends,
    performance of different customer classes, and understanding the regional distribution
    of electricity consumption.'
