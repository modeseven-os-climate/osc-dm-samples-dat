  description: This product encompasses an extensive dataset derived from the FERC
    Form 714, reporting annual respondents along with the county FIPS IDs corresponding
    to their service territories. It includes detailed information on both utilities
    and balancing authorities, identified by unique FERC respondent IDs specific to
    this form, distinct from other FERC forms. The dataset also integrates the EIA
    utility or balancing area authority IDs, which may coincide or differ as entities
    often serve dual roles. Key information contained in the dataset includes the
    name of the respondent entity, the type of respondent (utility or balancing authority),
    and the report date. This dataset provides a comprehensive overview of the service
    territories of various utilities and balancing authorities, facilitating analysis
    and decision-making for energy market professionals, regulatory agencies, and
    other stakeholders.
