  description: 'The dataset contains detailed information about fuel transportation
    modes as reported in the EIA-860 and EIA-923 forms. Specifically, it includes
    short codes, longer human-readable labels in snake_case, and detailed descriptions
    explaining each transportation mode. Examples of transportation modes include
    shipments of coal moved via Great Lakes coal loading docks (code: GL, label: great_lakes),
    instances where fuel is produced on-site, eliminating the need for shipment (code:
    OP, label: onsite_production), and shipments of fuel moved through pipelines (code:
    PL, label: pipeline). This dataset is useful for understanding the various methods
    by which fuel is transported to consumers or produced on-site. It is licensed
    under CC-BY-4.0.'
