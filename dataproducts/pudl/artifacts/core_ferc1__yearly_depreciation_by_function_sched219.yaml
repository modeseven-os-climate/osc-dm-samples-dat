  description: 'This dataset contains information on the accumulated provision for
    depreciation of electric utility plants as reported in FERC Account 108. The data
    is organized by Schedule 219 Section B, which outlines the functional plant classifications.
    Included in the dataset are entries detailing the yearly depreciation data for
    various utilities, which cover multiple depreciation types such as cost of removal,
    depreciation expenses, salvage, and cost of retired plant. Each entry includes
    several key data points:


    - utility_id_ferc1: A unique, PUDL-assigned identifier for each utility reporting
    to FERC, which may change from year to year.

    - report_year: The specific year for which the data was reported, represented
    as a four-digit number.

    - depreciation_type: The specific type of depreciation provision being documented,
    which could include costs associated with removal, depreciation expenses, salvage,
    and other related categories.

    - plant_function: The functional role of the plant, which can include categories
    like steam production, nuclear production, distribution, transmission, among others.

    - plant_status: The financial status of the utility plant, with categories such
    as in service, future, leased, and total.

    - utility_type: A classification of the utility plant types, including Electric
    Utility, Gas Utility, and potentially other types.


    Overall, this dataset provides a detailed view of how electric utility plants
    depreciate over time, broken down by various factors related to their function
    and status, which can aid in financial and operational planning for utility companies.'
