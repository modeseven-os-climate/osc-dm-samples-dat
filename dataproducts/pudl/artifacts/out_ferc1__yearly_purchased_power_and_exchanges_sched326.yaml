  description: 'The dataset provides a comprehensive collection of information on
    purchased power and exchange transactions reported by utilities through the FERC
    Form 1. It includes data spanning multiple years, offering a historical perspective
    on electricity procurement and exchanges at the utility level. Key pieces of information
    in the dataset include the report year, which indicates the year the data was
    collected and reported, and both a PUDL-assigned and a FERC1-assigned utility
    ID to uniquely identify each utility in the dataset. The utility name provides
    a human-readable identifier for the utility reporting the data.


    Additionally, the dataset details the seller name, or the counterpart in the transaction,
    offering insights into the trading partners and market relationships within the
    industry. Each transaction record is uniquely identified by a record ID, which
    ensures precise referencing and traceability back to the original FERC Form 1
    source document. The billing demand in megawatts (MW) is also noted, reflecting
    the monthly average billing demand associated with each transaction. This dataset
    is useful for analyzing trends in power purchases and exchanges, understanding
    utilities'' market activities, and investigating billing demand metrics over time.'
