  description: "Indicator Name: GDP (current US$)GDP at purchaser's prices is
     the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any
     product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products.
     It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets
     or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. Data are in current U.S.
     dollars. Dollar figures for GDP are converted from domestic currencies using
     single year official exchange rates. For a few countries where the official
     exchange rate does not reflect the rate effectively applied to actual foreign
     exchange transactions, an alternative conversion factor is used.ID: NY.GDP.MKTP.CD
