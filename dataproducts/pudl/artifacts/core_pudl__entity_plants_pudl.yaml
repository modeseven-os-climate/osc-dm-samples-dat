  description: "This dataset, from the core_pudl__entity_plants_pudl table, contains\
    \ details about power plants as catalogued by the Public Utility Data Liberation\
    \ (PUDL) project. Each plant is assigned a unique PUDL plant ID, which is manually\
    \ generated each year as new data from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\
    \ (FERC) and the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) are integrated.\
    \ The table includes 18,697 rows, with each row representing a distinct power\
    \ plant identified in at least one of these major data sources. \n\nThe columns\
    \ in this table are:\n1. plant_id_pudl: A unique identifier assigned to each plant\
    \ by PUDL. Note that this ID may not be consistent over time, as it can be updated\
    \ with new data integration cycles.\n2. plant_name_pudl: A readable plant name\
    \ chosen arbitrarily from the multiple names that might be reported during the\
    \ plant matching process.\n\nThis data is particularly useful for tracking and\
    \ analyzing power plants across different datasets and regulatory reports over\
    \ time. It facilitates efficient data integration and querying for researchers,\
    \ policymakers, and industry analysts interested in the energy sector. The dataset\
    \ is released under a CC-BY-4.0 license, endorsing open access and reuse with\
    \ appropriate credit."
