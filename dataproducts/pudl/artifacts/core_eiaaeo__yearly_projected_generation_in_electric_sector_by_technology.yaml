  description: 'The dataset provides projected generation capacity and total generation
    in the electric sector, categorized by different technologies. It includes data
    spanning 166,972 rows and offers the following key elements:


    1. Report Year: The four-digit year in which the data was reported.


    2. Electricity Market Module Region: The AEO projection region, which helps localize
    the data to specific geographic areas.


    3. Model Case: Various model scenarios run by the EIA to illustrate different
    outcomes based on factors like economic growth, oil prices, domestic energy resources,
    and technological progress. These scenarios provide a range of possibilities compared
    to the Reference case.


    4. Projection Year: The specific year for which the projected values are calculated.


    5. Technology Description: Details on the generation technology being reported,
    giving insight into the kind of energy production methods anticipated.


    6. Summer Capacity (MW): The net summer capacity in megawatts, providing information
    about the maximum electricity output during peak summer demand.


    This dataset is useful for analyzing future trends in electricity generation capacity
    and output, assessing the impact of different technologies, and understanding
    regional variations in projections.'
