  description: 'This product offers a comprehensive dataset that maps utility IDs
    assigned by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to their respective
    identifiers in the FERC database files (DBF). The dataset includes 411 rows, each
    representing a unique utility. Two primary columns are present: the "utility_id_ferc1,"
    an auto-incremented and non-stable ID assigned by the Public Utility Data Liberation
    (PUDL) project to identify FERC utilities, and the "utility_id_ferc1_dbf," a stable
    respondent ID assigned by FERC that identifies the reporting entity across multiple
    years. The mapping provided by this dataset allows for the cross-referencing of
    utility data between PUDL and FERC sources, aiding in data consistency and historical
    comparison between reported entities. The data is available under the CC-BY-4.0
    license, ensuring broad usability and adaptability. This product is essential
    for analysts and researchers who require detailed and accurate identification
    of utilities for regulatory, compliance, or study purposes.'
