  description: "The core FERC Form 1 Annual Sales by Rate Schedules (sched304) data\
    \ table provides detailed insights into electricity sales segmented by different\
    \ rate schedules. This data spans from years prior to 2021 through to the present,\
    \ capturing a wide range of information relevant to the energy industry. Post-2020\
    \ data, extracted via XBRL, is structured and categorized into specific rate schedule\
    \ types such as residential, industrial, commercial, public lighting, public authorities,\
    \ railroads, interdepartmental, provision for rate refund, commercial and industrial,\
    \ and totals. Additionally, it includes billing status categorized as billed,\
    \ unbilled, and total. \n\nPrior to 2021, data extracted from FoxProDB is less\
    \ structured and more challenging to parse. Information related to rate schedules\
    \ in this older data is often embedded within the rate_schedule_description column,\
    \ which can include varied and sometimes ambiguous details such as numbers and\
    \ acronyms. This column often does not provide a clear context, making early data\
    \ less straightforward to analyze in bulk.\n\nIn summary, this dataset offers\
    \ comprehensive historical and current details on electricity sales by different\
    \ rate schedules, with a shift towards more structured and categorized information\
    \ in recent years. This data is crucial for understanding market trends, analyzing\
    \ consumer segments, and making informed decisions in the energy sector."
