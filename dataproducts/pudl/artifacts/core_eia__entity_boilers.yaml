  description: 'The data set contains static boiler attributes compiled from the EIA-860
    and EIA-923 data, providing essential information pertinent to energy generation
    facilities. Each entry includes a unique six-digit facility identification number
    known as the plant ID assigned by the Energy Information Administration (EIA),
    which ensures the precise identification of the location. Additionally, each boiler
    is identified by an alphanumeric boiler ID, which helps in distinguishing between
    multiple boilers within the same facility.


    The data offers details about the boiler manufacturer, providing the full name
    of the company that produced the boiler. This is complemented by an EIA short
    code for the manufacturer, which serves as a quick reference or abbreviation for
    the manufacturer''s full name. The data set includes 6,886 rows, indicating the
    extensive range of boiler-related data available.


    This comprehensive collection of boiler attributes is useful for various stakeholders,
    including energy analysts, utility companies, and regulators, providing them with
    detailed information necessary for performance assessment, regulatory compliance,
    and operational planning. Access to manufacturer details also facilitates maintenance
    planning, procurement decisions, and reliability assessments.'
