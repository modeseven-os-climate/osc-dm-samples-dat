  description: This dataset is a denormalized table containing information on electric
    energy dispositions as reported in FERC Form 1. It includes detailed data on various
    types of energy dispositions such as sales to customers, energy re-sales, internally
    used energy, and energy losses. Each row in the dataset corresponds to a specific
    utility, identified by unique PUDL and FERC-assigned utility IDs, and provides
    the utility's name, the year of the report, the type of energy disposition, and
    the energy amount in megawatt-hours (MWh). The table also indicates whether the
    disposition value was calculated or uniquely reported within the dataset. This
    data can be utilized for comprehensive analysis of energy distribution patterns
    across different utilities over multiple years.
