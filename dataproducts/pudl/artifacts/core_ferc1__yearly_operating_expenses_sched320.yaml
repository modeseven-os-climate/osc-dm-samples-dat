  description: 'The dataset contains records of operating and maintenance costs associated
    with producing electricity, as reported in Schedule 320 of FERC Form 1. Each record
    includes several key data points: a PUDL-assigned utility ID that uniquely identifies
    each utility within the dataset; the year the data was reported; the dollar value
    of the reported income, expense, asset, or liability; the type of expense recorded;
    and an identifier indicating the original source record from FERC Form 1, which
    ensures the traceability of each entry. The data also specifies the type of utility
    plant, such as Electric Utility, Gas Utility, and Other Utility, as well as the
    actual FERC Account number related to each record. This comprehensive dataset
    can be used for financial analysis, cost assessment, and performance evaluation
    of utility companies.'
