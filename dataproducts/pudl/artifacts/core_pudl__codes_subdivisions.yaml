  description: This dataset provides various static attributes associated with states,
    provinces, and other sub-national political subdivisions. It includes the three-letter
    ISO-3166 country code, full country name, and two-letter ISO-3166 political subdivision
    codes, like US state or Canadian province abbreviations (e.g., CA or AB). The
    dataset also lists the full names of these political subdivisions, such as US
    states or Canadian provinces like California or Alberta, and the subdivision type
    classified by ISO-3166 (e.g., state, province, outlying area). Additionally, the
    dataset contains the IANA timezone names which encompass the largest portion of
    the population in the respective geographic areas, two-digit state FIPS codes,
    longer human-readable names describing the US Census division, and corresponding
    division codes for the US Census. This data is valuable for businesses and researchers
    needing detailed and standardized geographical and administrative information
    on sub-national divisions.
