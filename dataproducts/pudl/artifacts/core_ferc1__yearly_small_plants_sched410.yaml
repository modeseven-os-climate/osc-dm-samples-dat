  description: The core_ferc1__yearly_small_plants_sched410 data table provides detailed
    generating plant statistics for power plants with smaller installed nameplate
    capacities, specifically focusing on internal combustion plants, gas turbine plants,
    conventional hydro plants, and pumped storage plants with less than 10 MW, as
    well as steam plants with less than 25 MW. This dataset is compiled from FERC
    Form 1 Schedule 410 (pages 410-411) and includes data extracted from both the
    FERC Visual FoxPro and XBRL formats. The raw data is somewhat unstructured, similar
    to a digitized PDF, and consists of various types of rows, including headers,
    notes, and totals, which provide additional contextual information. However, this
    unstructured format necessitates transformations to separate and properly analyze
    the values data. This dataset is essential for analyzing the performance and characteristics
    of smaller power plants, offering insights into their operational statistics and
    contributions to the overall energy grid.
