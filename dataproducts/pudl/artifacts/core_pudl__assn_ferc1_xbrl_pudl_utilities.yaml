  description: The "core_pudl__assn_ferc1_xbrl_pudl_utilities" table serves as a centralized
    map for aligning utility IDs assigned by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
    (FERC) with those assigned by the Public Utility Data Liberation (PUDL) project.
    It contains 272 rows, each representing an individual utility. Key columns include
    the "utility_id_ferc1," which is the PUDL-assigned ID for a FERC1 utility and
    subject to change annually, and the "utility_id_ferc1_xbrl," which is the stable
    FERC-assigned entity ID from XBRL reporting years. This table facilitates the
    connection between diverse datasets by providing consistent and stable identifiers
    for utilities reported under FERC's XBRL system.
