  description: The core_ferc1__yearly_plant_in_service_sched204 dataset contains detailed
    information about balances and changes to FERC Electric Plant in Service accounts,
    as reported by utilities on FERC Form 1, Schedule 204. Originating from the f1_plant_in_srvce
    table in FERC's FoxPro database, this dataset includes data on various electric
    plant accounts as defined in the FERC Uniform System of Accounts (part of the
    Code of Federal Regulations, Title 18, Chapter I, Subchapter C, Part 101). Each
    year, FERC respondents report the starting and ending balances for each account,
    capturing organization-wide data that is not broken down on a per-plant basis.
    The end-of-year balance for each account is expected to equal the beginning-of-year
    balance plus the sum of additions, retirements, adjustments, and transfers within
    the account. The dataset, containing 335,756 rows, is assigned a PUDL-assigned
    utility ID to identify each FERC utility. The data is made available under a CC-BY-4.0
    license.
