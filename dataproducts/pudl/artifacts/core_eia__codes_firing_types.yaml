  description: 'The dataset contains coding information related to different boiler
    firing types as reported in the EIA-860. It consists of three main attributes:
    a short code (representing the originally reported short code), a label (providing
    a longer, human-readable code in snake_case), and a description (offering a detailed
    explanation of what the code and label signify). The dataset includes various
    types of boiler designs such as cell burner (CB), cyclone firing (CY), duct burner
    (DB), fluidized bed firing (FB), and stoker (SS). It also includes a category
    labeled "other" (OT) for boiler types that do not fit into the predefined categories
    and require specification on Schedule 7. This dataset is essential for understanding
    the specific configurations and technologies employed in different boiler systems
    as reported by facilities.'
