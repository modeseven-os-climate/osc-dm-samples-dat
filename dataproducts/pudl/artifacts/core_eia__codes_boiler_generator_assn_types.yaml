  description: 'The core_eia__codes_boiler_generator_assn_types table provides information
    about the different types of boiler-generator associations as reported in the
    EIA-860. It contains two main columns: ''code'' which represents the originally
    reported short code, and ''label'' which gives a longer, more human-readable code
    in snake_case format. Additionally, there is a ''description'' column that offers
    a detailed explanation of what each code and label signifies. The data distinguishes
    between actual and theoretical boiler-generator associations. This information
    can be crucial for understanding and analyzing boiler-generator relationships
    within energy data.'
