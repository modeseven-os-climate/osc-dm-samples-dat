  description: The dataset contains detailed information about small hydroelectric
    plants reported in FERC Form 1. It includes nearly 7,000 rows of data that capture
    a range of details for each plant on a yearly basis. The data encompasses utility-specific
    identifiers, such as the PUDL and FERC1 utility IDs, ensuring the unique identification
    of each utility reporting to FERC. Additional information includes the name of
    the utility and the plant as reported in the forms, providing clear references
    for each entry. Each record is uniquely identified through a structured record
    ID format, ensuring data traceability back to original FERC Form 1 submissions.
    This dataset supports analysis of small hydroelectric plants' operational and
    ownership characteristics across different years, helping stakeholders understand
    patterns, trends, and changes in the industry.
