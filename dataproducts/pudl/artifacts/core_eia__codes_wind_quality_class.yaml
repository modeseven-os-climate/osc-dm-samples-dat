  description: 'The dataset "core_eia__codes_wind_quality_class" provides a comprehensive
    classification of wind quality for use in various applications, particularly in
    the energy sector. Each entry in the dataset represents a specific wind quality
    class, characterized by a unique short code and a more descriptive human-readable
    label. The dataset details several key attributes that define the wind quality
    class: the average wind speed measured in meters per second, the extreme 50-year
    wind gusts in meters per hour, and the turbulence intensity at the wind site,
    divided into upper and lower bounds. These attributes allow for a detailed understanding
    of the environmental conditions at a given location, which is critical for the
    planning, deployment, and management of wind energy projects. The data is licensed
    under CC-BY-4.0, ensuring it is accessible for use and distribution under the
    specified terms.'
