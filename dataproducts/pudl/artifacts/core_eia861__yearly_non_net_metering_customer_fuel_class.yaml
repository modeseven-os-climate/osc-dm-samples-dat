  description: The product provides a comprehensive dataset related to non-net metered
    distributed generation by sector and technology type. It includes detailed information
    on the total installed capacity measured in megawatts for different customer classes,
    which are categorized as commercial, industrial, direct connection, other, residential,
    total, transportation, and commercial other. The data tracks these parameters
    across various balancing authorities, using a specific short code to identify
    each authority, and includes coverage for Canadian and Mexican authorities. The
    provided data ensures that there is no double counting of distributed generation
    capacity, converting values reported in DC units to AC units where applicable.
    This dataset is crucial for understanding the distribution and capacity of non-net
    metered generation sources across different sectors and geographical areas.
