  description: The dataset contains detailed information from the FERC Form 1 regarding
    Electric Plant in Service. It includes 335,756 records of data covering various
    report years for utilities under FERC jurisdiction. Each record includes the four-digit
    year of the data report, a PUDL-assigned utility ID for tracking, and a manually
    assigned PUDL utility ID for stability over time. Additionally, the dataset provides
    the name of the responding utility as reported in FERC Form 1 for readability.
    The utility types are also listed, such as Electric Utility, Gas Utility, and
    other types of utilities. The plant status is documented, indicating whether the
    utility plant is in service, planned for the future, leased, or if it represents
    the total utility plant. Unique identifiers accompany each record, indicating
    the original FERC Form 1 source record, aiding in traceability and data validation.
