  description: 'The dataset contains information about different types of boiler regulatory
    codes used in the EIA-860 forms. It includes a coding table with three main fields:
    code, label, and description. The "code" field contains originally reported short
    codes, such as ''D'', ''Da'', and ''Db''. The "label" field provides longer, human-readable
    labels in snake_case format. Finally, the "description" field offers a detailed
    explanation of the meaning of each code or label. For instance, the code ''D''
    corresponds to boilers subject to the Standards of Performance for fossil-fuel
    fired steam boilers constructed after August 17, 1971, while ''Da'' pertains to
    those constructed after September 18, 1978, and ''Db'' to those after a yet unspecified
    date in 1984. This data is useful for understanding regulatory classifications
    and performance standards for fossil-fuel fired steam boilers.'
