  description: 'The core_eia861_yearly_demand_side_management_misc dataset contains
    a variety of information related to demand-side management (DSM) activities reported
    by utilities in the EIA861 form. This dataset encompasses a range of miscellaneous
    information, including fields that indicate whether the reported energy savings
    estimates and calculations were independently verified. Additionally, it provides
    details on whether the utility offers time-based or price-responsive programs
    to its customers.


    The dataset also includes data about whether the respondent''s DSM activities
    are reported under another company, and if so, identifies which company. This
    helps in understanding the organizational structure and reporting practices of
    DSM activities. The dataset covers data up to the year 2012, after which the reporting
    structure changed and split the DSM information into separate energy efficiency
    and demand response tables, making it difficult to directly compare data from
    before and after this change.


    Overall, this dataset is valuable for analyzing the verification and type of DSM
    programs utilities engage in, as well as understanding the reporting structures
    and practices of these utilities up to 2012.'
