  description: 'The "core_eia861__yearly_net_metering_misc" dataset offers comprehensive
    information related to net metered capacity for photovoltaics (PV). The key data
    points include:


    1. **Balancing Authority Code (EIA)**: This field contains the EIA short code
    that identifies different balancing authorities, which may also include entities
    in Canada and Mexico.

    2. **PV Current Flow Type**: Information on whether the PV current flow is alternating
    current (AC) or direct current (DC).

    3. **Report Date**: The specific date on which the data was reported.

    4. **State**: Two-letter abbreviations representing US states.

    5. **EIA Utility Identification Number**: Unique identification number assigned
    by the EIA to each utility.

    6. **Data Maturity**: Indicates the level of data maturity, which informs users
    about the finality and reliability of the data. Some records might be less-than-final
    and should be used cautiously.


    The dataset contains a substantial volume of rows, amounting to a total of 14,942,
    each representing a unique record of net metering data related to PVs. This data
