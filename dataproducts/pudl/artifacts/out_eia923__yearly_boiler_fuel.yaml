  description: The dataset from EIA-923 Schedule 3 contains detailed information on
    monthly boiler fuel consumption and emissions. This includes the quantity of various
    fuel types used by boilers, reported in standard EIA fuel units such as tons,
    barrels, and Mcf (thousand cubic feet). Additionally, the dataset provides data
    on the sulfur and ash content of these fuels, as well as their heat content per
    unit. This information is crucial for calculating the thermal efficiency, or heat
    rate, of different generation units. While this table offers comprehensive coverage
    of the entire generator fleet, the reported fuel consumption is linked to boilers
    rather than directly to generators. This can complicate heat rate calculations
    because the relationships between individual boilers and generators may be incomplete
    or complex. It's important to note that some respondents only report annual fuel
    consumption, which is also included in the dataset. Overall, this dataset is valuable
    for analyzing fuel usage, emissions, and efficiency within the power generation
    sector.
