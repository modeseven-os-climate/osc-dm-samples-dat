  description: The dataset provides information regarding the operational status codes
    as reported to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). It includes a collection
    of 18 rows, each detailing various codes, their corresponding labels, and long
    descriptions explaining each code's meaning. The "code" column consists of short
    originally reported codes, while the "label" column offers longer, human-readable
    versions of these codes in a snake_case format. The "description" column provides
    comprehensive explanations of what each code or label signifies. Additionally,
    there is an "operational_status" column that describes the operational status
    of assets, particularly generators, based on their listing in relevant EIA forms,
    such as EIA-860. This dataset is useful for understanding and interpreting the
    operational status of energy assets as per official EIA records.
