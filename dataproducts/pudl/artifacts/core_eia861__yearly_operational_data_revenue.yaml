  description: 'The dataset contains yearly operational data on electric utility revenue,
    providing insights into the financial performance of utilities by capturing various
    revenue streams. Each record includes the utility''s identification number, the
    date of the report, and the state in which the utility operates. Key data elements
    include the NERC region, which specifies the North American Electric Reliability
    Corporation region where the utility is located, and the amount of revenue reported.


    Revenue is categorized by different types, including retail sales, unbundled delivery
    customers, sales for resale, transmission, and other electric operating revenues.
    Additionally, the dataset includes categories for total electric operating revenue
    and credits or other adjustments. This comprehensive breakdown allows for detailed
    analysis of revenue sources and trends across different states and regions. The
    dataset also indicates the level of maturity of the data record, providing context
    for the reliability and completeness of the information.'
