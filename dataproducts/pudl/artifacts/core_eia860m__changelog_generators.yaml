  description: This data product is a changelog of the monthly reported EIA-860M data,
    specifically focusing on generator information. EIA-860M provides an up-to-date
    catalog of electrical generators in the United States, detailing their operational
    status and various characteristics. The primary utility of this table is to track
    changes in generator data over time. For each generator, there is an initial record
    with an associated report date and a valid until date. Whenever any data related
    to a generator is updated, a new record is added with the updated information
    and a new report date. This allows users to see the history of any changes made
    to generator characteristics on a monthly basis. The dataset includes fields indicating
    the date the data was reported and the date until which the record is valid, providing
    a clear timeline of changes. This product is valuable for monitoring trends, ensuring
    data accuracy, and conducting longitudinal analyses of the US electrical generator
    landscape.
