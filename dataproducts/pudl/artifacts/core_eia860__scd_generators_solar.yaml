  description: This dataset contains annually reported information about solar generators
    from the EIA-860 Schedule 3.3. It includes unique values specific to solar generators,
    such as standard testing conditions capacity in megawatts direct current (MWdc)
    and net metering capacity in MW. The dataset identifies individual facilities
    using a unique six-digit plant identification number (plant_id_eia) and a generator
    ID (generator_id), which may include both numeric and alphabetic characters. The
    data spans several years, with each entry being tagged with a report date. The
    dataset aims to provide detailed insights into the capacity and characteristics
    of solar generators across various locations, helping businesses and policymakers
    analyze trends and plan for energy production and distribution.
