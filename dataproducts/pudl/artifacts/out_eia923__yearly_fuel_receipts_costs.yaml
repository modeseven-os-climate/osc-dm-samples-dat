  description: The dataset contains detailed information on fuel deliveries to power
    plants as reported in the EIA-923 Schedule 2, Part A. Each record represents an
    individual fuel delivery, capturing different attributes such as the type of fuel,
    the supplier, the receiving plant, and the specifics of each delivery. In cases
    where the same type of fuel is delivered multiple times from the same supplier
    to the same plant within a month, each delivery is recorded separately. It is
    important to note that there can be a delay between the receipt of fuel and its
    actual consumption, which may affect attempts to infer monthly power generation
    attributes directly from this data. Despite this, the dataset is crucial for calculating
    the marginal cost of electricity for individual generation units, as it provides
    the most granular data available on fuel costs. However, under certain circumstances,
    utilities are permitted to treat fuel prices as proprietary business information,
    which results in some price data being redacted from publicly accessible spreadsheets.
    Despite redactions, this data is still reported to the EIA and impacts aggregated
    statistics.
