  description: 'The dataset "out_eia__yearly_boilers" is part of the Public Utility
    Data Liberation (PUDL) project and contains detailed information about boilers
    in power plants as reported to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).
    The table includes 86,675 rows and various attributes related to each boiler.
    Key data points include:


    1. **report_date**: The date when the data was reported.

    2. **plant_id_eia**: A unique six-digit identification number assigned to each
    facility by the EIA.

    3. **plant_id_pudl**: A unique identifier assigned by the PUDL system, which may
    change over time.

    4. **plant_name_eia**: The name of the plant.

    5. **utility_id_eia**: The EIA''s utility identification number.

    6. **utility_id_pudl**: A unique utility identifier assigned by PUDL, which may
    also change over time.

    7. **utility_name_eia**: The name of the utility operating the plant.

    8. **boiler_id**: A unique alphanumeric identifier for each boiler.

    9. **air_flow_100pct_load_cubic_feet_per_minute**: The total air flow, including
    excess air, measured at 100 percent load under standard temperature and pressure
    conditions.

    10. **boiler_fuel_code_1**: The code representing the primary type of fuel used
    by the boiler.

    11. **boiler_fuel_code_2**: The code representing the secondary type of fuel used
    by the boiler.
