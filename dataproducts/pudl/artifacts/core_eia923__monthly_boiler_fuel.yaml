  description: The EIA-923 Monthly Boiler Fuel Consumption and Emissions dataset provides
    detailed information about the fuel usage and emissions of boilers on a monthly
    basis. The data includes the quantity of each type of fuel consumed by individual
    boilers, measured in standard EIA fuel units such as tons, barrels, and Mcf (thousand
    cubic feet). Additionally, it includes important attributes like the sulfur and
    ash content of these fuels, as well as their heat content per unit. This dataset
    is useful for calculating the thermal efficiency or heat rate of various generation
    units, although the lack of direct associations between fuel consumption and individual
    generators can complicate these calculations. The dataset offers better coverage
    of the entire fleet of generators compared to other tables that only report fuel
    consumption tied to electricity generation. Note that while most data is reported
    monthly, a small number of respondents provide only annual fuel consumption data.
