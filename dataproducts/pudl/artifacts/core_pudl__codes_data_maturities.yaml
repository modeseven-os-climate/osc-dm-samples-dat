  description: The dataset comprises information about the maturities of data records
    reported by various sources. It contains codes indicating the status of the data,
    specifically identifying whether it is a final, validated dataset or if it is
    data that is interim or iterative in nature. The four main maturity levels detailed
    in the dataset are "final," which represents data that has been thoroughly reviewed
    and is deemed complete by the publishing agency, though it can still be subject
    to future revisions. "Incremental_ytd" refers to sub-annual data releases that
    are updated periodically and should be used with caution. The remaining two entries
    would provide further categories and nuances in the data maturation process, aiding
    users in understanding the reliability and completeness of the data being reported.
    This structured information is essential for users to assess the appropriateness
    of the data for their specific analyses and decision-making processes.
