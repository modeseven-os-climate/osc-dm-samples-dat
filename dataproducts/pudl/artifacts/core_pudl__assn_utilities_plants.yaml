  description: 'The data set called "Associations between PUDL utility IDs and PUDL
    plant IDs" provides a detailed mapping between utility companies and the power
    plants they operate. Each entry consists of two key fields: "utility_id_pudl"
    and "plant_id_pudl." The "utility_id_pudl" field is a manually assigned identifier
    for utility companies, while the "plant_id_pudl" field represents a unique identifier
    for power plants. This association helps in tracking and managing utility companies
    and their respective power plants effectively. The data can be used for various
    analyses, including operational assessments, regulatory compliance, market research,
    and infrastructure planning. The data caters to needs such as identifying relationships
    between utilities and their plants, analyzing regional electricity markets, and
    performing detailed industry research for policy-making and strategic decisions.
    With a total of 17,624 rows, this comprehensive mapping offers an extensive overview
    of the relationships within the energy sector.'
