  description: "Our high-level business product focuses on detailed information about\
    \ coal mines that report deliveries as documented in the EIA-923 Schedule 2, Part\
    \ C. This dataset includes attributes from coal mines, streamlined during the\
    \ transformation of fuel delivery data, to ensure a more normalized database structure.\
    \ Despite ongoing challenges with unstandardized vocabulary and identification\
    \ practices, this dataset offers insights into various mine attributes without\
    \ repetitive entry\u2014making it more efficient.\n\nThe dataset consists of 4,615\
    \ rows, each representing unique mine-related data points. While the data has\
    \ not been rigorously cleaned, it offers substantial potential for integration\
    \ with data from the Mining Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) and the United\
    \ States Geological Survey (USGS). Such linkages would enhance the dataset, providing\
    \ greater insight into the origins of coal, as well as contextual employment and\
    \ geological information relevant to the coal supply chain. This comprehensive\
    \ data can be invaluable for those looking to understand the broader landscape\
    \ of coal mining operations in the United States."
