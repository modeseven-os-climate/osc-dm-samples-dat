  description: 'The dataset contains fuel information from FERC Form 1, specifically
    focusing on yearly steam plants. It comprises 50,039 rows of data and includes
    the following key fields:


    - **report_year**: Indicates the four-digit year in which the data was reported.

    - **utility_id_ferc1**: A PUDL-assigned utility ID that identifies a FERC1 utility.
    This is an auto-incremented ID and is expected to change from year to year.

    - **utility_id_pudl**: A manually assigned PUDL utility ID which may not remain
    stable over time.

    - **utility_name_ferc1**: The name of the responding utility as reported in FERC
    Form 1, primarily for human readability.

    - **plant_id_pudl**: A manually assigned PUDL plant ID, which may not be constant
    over time.

    - **plant_name_ferc1**: The reported name of the plant, which is a freeform string
    and may not be consistent across different references.

    - **fuel_consumed_mmbtu**: The total consumption of fuel in physical units, reported
    year-to-date. Note that this reflects the total quantity consumed for both electricity
    and other uses within the year.


    This dataset is valuable for analyzing fuel consumption patterns and trends at
    steam plants across various utilities, offering insights into energy use and efficiency
    in the power generation sector.'
