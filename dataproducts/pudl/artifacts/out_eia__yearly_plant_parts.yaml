  description: The "EIA Yearly Plant Parts" dataset is a comprehensive aggregation
    of data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) regarding power
    plants, sourced from EIA 923 and EIA 860 reports. It includes records related
    to generators and plants, focusing on various attributes that characterize these
    generators. Key data points in this dataset include the specific prime movers
    used, primary fuel sources, and technology types. By grouping generators with
    identical attributes and utility owners, the dataset creates larger aggregate
    records known as "plant parts." These plant parts provide insights into collections
    of generators, such as all generators within a particular unit, or those using
    a specific fuel type like coal. The dataset encompasses a wide range of records
    (4,738,788 rows), making it a valuable resource for detailed analyses and cross-referencing
    with other datasets like FERC 1. The information serves multiple purposes, including
    operational analysis, regulatory compliance, and strategic planning for power
    generation and utility management.
