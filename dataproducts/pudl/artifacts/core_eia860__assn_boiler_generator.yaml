  description: The dataset "core_eia860_assn_boiler_generator" captures detailed associations
    between boilers and generators at various power plants. It is derived from EIA-860
    Schedule 6, Part A, and is augmented using heuristics from the Public Utility
    Data Liberation (PUDL) project. The data provides key attributes such as the unique
    plant ID (plant_id_eia), report date (report_date), generator ID (generator_id),
    and boiler ID (boiler_id). Additionally, it includes both EIA and dynamically
    assigned unit IDs (unit_id_eia and unit_id_pudl), which help in identifying specific
    units within a plant. Historical details about the nature of boiler-generator
    associations and steam plant types are also available through the boiler_generator_assn_type_code
    and steam_plant_type_code, although some of this information, like association
    type, is only provided for years before 2013. Overall, this dataset offers a comprehensive
    view of the operational relationships between boilers and generators in power
    plants, which can be critical for analyzing plant efficiency, maintenance schedules,
    and overall performance.
