  description: 'The dataset contains yearly projections of costs and performance for
    various electricity generation technologies, reported annually. It includes information
    on the financial assumptions used by NREL, covering two main cases: R&D Only Case
    and Market + Policies Case. The R&D Only Case incorporates only projected research
    and development improvements, while the Market + Policies Case includes policy
    and tax incentives. Each entry in the dataset provides the following details:
    the report year, the projection year for the cost or performance estimate, a high-level
    description of the technology, the cost recovery period in years, and the scenario
    under which the technology innovation is considered. This data is useful for understanding
    potential future costs and performance metrics for different electricity generation
    technologies under varying R&D and policy conditions.'
