  description: 'This dataset contains information on different types of cooling water
    sources reported in the EIA-860 forms. Each record includes a code representing
    a specific cooling water source, a label providing a human-readable identifier,
    and a detailed description explaining the meaning of the code. The dataset catalogs
    four primary types of cooling water sources: ground water, surface water, plant
    discharge water, and other unspecified sources. Ground water refers to water from
    aquifers or wells, surface water includes rivers, canals, and bays, plant discharge
    water consists of water discharged from wastewater treatment plants, and the ''other''
    category is for sources that must be specified separately. This dataset serves
    as a reference for understanding the provenance and categorization of cooling
    water sources in energy infrastructure data.'
