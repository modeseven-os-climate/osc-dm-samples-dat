  description: "The product includes a coding table which provides comprehensive information\
    \ about balancing authorities as recorded in EIA-860, EIA-923, and EIA-930 datasets.\
    \ The data in this table includes originally reported short codes and their longer\
    \ human-readable versions in snake_case format. Each entry is accompanied by a\
    \ detailed description explaining the meaning of the code and label.\n\nAdditionally,\
    \ the table contains the EIA balancing authority region code and its corresponding\
    \ human-readable name. There is information about the timezone used by each reporting\
    \ entity, which can be useful for localizing UTC times. The product also details\
    \ the retirement date for any balancing authority that has ceased independent\
    \ operation.\n\nThis coding table also specifies whether the balancing authority\
    \ is generation-only. This is particularly pertinent for authorities that do not\
    \ serve retail customers and therefore only report net generation and interchange\
    \ data, without any demand data. \n\nAltogether, this product provides a structured\
    \ and detailed overview of various balancing authorities, their operational specifics,\
    \ and relevant metadata, aiding in the clarity and understanding of EIA reports."
