  description: The Yearly Generation Fuel by Generator Energy Source Owner dataset
    offers comprehensive data on the estimated net electricity generation and fuel
    consumption for individual generators. This data is categorized by unique combinations
    of generator, energy source, prime mover, and owner. Specifically, the dataset
    includes information on the net electricity generation and fuel consumption as
    reported in the EIA-923 generation fuel, which is subsequently allocated to individual
    generators. These allocations are then aggregated based on unique generator, prime
    mover, and energy source codes. It is important to note that the utility_id_eia
    refers to the owner of the generator and not the operator. The dataset does not
    differentiate between primary and secondary energy sources and allocates net generation
    equally between energy source codes when multiple generators with the same prime
    mover but different energy sources exist. This detailed granularity aids in understanding
    the generation and fuel consumption patterns across different energy sources and
    ownership, providing valuable insights for energy analysts, policymakers, and
    industry stakeholders.
