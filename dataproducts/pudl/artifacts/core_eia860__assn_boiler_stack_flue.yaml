  description: The table "core_eia860__assn_boiler_stack_flue" provides detailed information
    about the linkage between boilers and the corresponding stacks or flues in various
    facilities, as reported to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). For each
    record, the table includes a report date, a unique six-digit plant identification
    number (plant_id_eia), and an alphanumeric boiler identifier (boiler_id). It also
    provides information on the stack or flue where emissions are released, identified
    by either a stack_id_eia or flue_id_eia, or the combined stack_flue_id_eia value
    from 2013 onward. This dataset contains 41,673 rows of such linkages, offering
    a comprehensive view of the connections between boiler units and their emission
    points across different facilities. This information is crucial for understanding
    emission management, regulatory compliance, and the environmental impact of energy
    production operations.
