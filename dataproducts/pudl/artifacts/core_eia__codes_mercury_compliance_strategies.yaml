  description: This dataset contains information on different compliance strategies
    used to control mercury emissions as reported in the EIA-860 forms. It includes
    25 rows of data, each detailing a specific code, a human-readable label, and a
    description of the compliance strategy. For example, some of the compliance strategies
    listed are "activated_carbon_injection" (ACI), which refers to an activated carbon
    injection system used to control mercury emissions, and "baghouse" (BH), which
    is a fabric filter system. The dataset further distinguishes specific types of
    baghouse systems, such as "baghouse_pulse" and "baghouse_reverse_air." Each entry
    provides a concise code, an easily readable label, and a detailed explanation
    of what that code or label represents, offering a comprehensive overview of the
    various mercury compliance methods utilized in energy production facilities.
