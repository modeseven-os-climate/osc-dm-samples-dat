  description: The core_eia861__yearly_dynamic_pricing dataset provides detailed information
    about customers enrolled in various dynamic pricing programs across different
    states, sectors, and balancing authorities. This data includes the number of customers
    participating in time-of-use pricing, real-time pricing, variable peak pricing,
    critical peak pricing, and critical peak rebates. Each record contains a unique
    EIA short code identifying the balancing authority, whether customers are participating
    in critical peak pricing, and whether customers are participating in critical
    peak rebates. This dataset, with 28,888 rows, serves as a valuable resource for
    analyzing the adoption and distribution of dynamic pricing programs nationwide,
    offering insights for energy providers, policy makers, and researchers interested
    in market trends and consumer behavior.
