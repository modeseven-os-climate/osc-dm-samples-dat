  description: This dataset contains detailed information about cooling equipment
    used at generation facilities, as reported in the EIA-860 Schedule 6D. It includes
    26,089 rows of data, providing insights into the cooling systems utilized across
    various power plants. Key pieces of information include the unique six-digit facility
    identification number (plant_id_eia) assigned by the Energy Information Administration
    (EIA), plant names (plant_name_eia), and EIA Identification codes for cooling
    systems (cooling_id_eia). The dataset also features utility identifiers (utility_id_eia),
    utility names (utility_name_eia), and county names where these facilities are
    located. While the data has been cleaned, it has not been harvested with other
    EIA 923 or 860 data, meaning similar variables may be present in other related
    tables. This dataset is licensed under CC-BY-4.0, allowing for broad use with
    proper attribution.
