  description: 'The core_eia__codes_regulations dataset provides an overview of the
    various statutory and regulatory levels that boilers operate under as reported
    in the EIA-860. It contains three key fields for each entry: a short code, a longer
    human-readable code in snake_case, and a detailed description of what each code
    signifies. Specifically, the dataset details whether the most stringent applicable
    pollutant control standards for a boiler are governed by federal or local statutes
    and regulations. This information is crucial for entities needing to understand
    the regulatory environment for boiler operations, ensuring compliance with the
    most stringent pollution control standards applicable.'
