  description: "The EIA-923 Cooling System Information dataset encompasses detailed\
    \ monthly data on cooling systems at generation facilities, emphasizing water\
    \ volumes and temperatures. This dataset covers the years 2008 to present. In\
    \ 2008 and 2009, it provides annual averages, while from 2010 onwards, it details\
    \ monthly figures. \n\nEach record within the dataset includes the report date,\
    \ unique six-digit facility identification number (ORISPL), and an EIA identification\
    \ code for cooling systems. This data helps in understanding the cooling operations\
    \ of power plants, tracking the environmental impacts of cooling water usage,\
    \ and assessing compliance with regulations that govern thermal discharges. \n\
    \nThe dataset's inclusion of granular, time-specific information makes it suited\
    \ for analysis concerning the water use efficiency and environmental impacts of\
    \ power plant cooling processes across years and months. This information can\
    \ be instrumental for regulatory bodies, environmental researchers, utility companies,\
    \ and policymakers aiming to optimize cooling system operations, minimize ecological\
    \ footprints, and better manage water resources around power generation facilities."
