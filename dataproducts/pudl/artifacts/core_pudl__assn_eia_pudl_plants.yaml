  description: 'The dataset titled "Association between EIA Plant IDs and manually
    assigned PUDL Plant IDs" consists of 16,857 rows that map the unique six-digit
    facility identification numbers (also known as ORISPL) assigned by the Energy
    Information Administration (EIA) to their corresponding PUDL Plant IDs. Each entry
    includes:


    1. **plant_id_eia**: The unique six-digit facility identification number assigned
    by the EIA.

    2. **plant_name_eia**: The name of the plant as provided by the EIA.

    3. **plant_id_pudl**: A manually assigned PUDL plant ID, which may not be constant
    over time.


    This data is valuable for organizations and analysts looking to cross-reference
    between EIA-assigned IDs and PUDL-assigned IDs, enabling more seamless integration
    of energy facility data from different sources. This dataset facilitates the accurate
    and consistent identification of energy plants across various datasets and time
    periods.'
