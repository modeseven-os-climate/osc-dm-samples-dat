  description: The dataset contains unique utility IDs and utility names related to
    entities involved in owning or operating power plants. These IDs are manually
    assigned by PUDL (Public Utility Data Liberation) to ensure consistency across
    datasets such as those from FERC (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) and EIA
    (Energy Information Administration). Each utility ID maps to one power plant operating
    or owning entity that is reported in at least one of these datasets. The utility
    names are chosen arbitrarily during the matching process and are provided for
    human readability. The dataset is updated annually with new utility IDs when new
    FERC and EIA reports are integrated. The table is sourced from a spreadsheet maintained
    in the PUDL repository. There are 16,118 rows in this table, which captures a
    comprehensive list of utility entities over time.
