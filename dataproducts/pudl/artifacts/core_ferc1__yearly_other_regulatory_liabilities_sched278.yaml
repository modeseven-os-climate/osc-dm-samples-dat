  description: The dataset contains information on other regulatory liabilities reported
    by utilities to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) on an annual basis.
    The data covers several key elements including the utility identifier, the year
    of the report, and a detailed description of the regulatory liabilities. It also
    includes financial details such as the starting and ending balances of the liabilities
    for the year, any increases or decreases in the liabilities during the reporting
    period, and specific accounts credited for the adjustments made. This dataset
    provides a comprehensive view of financial changes in regulatory liabilities for
    utilities over multiple years, which can be useful for regulatory analysis, financial
    auditing, and industry benchmarking.
