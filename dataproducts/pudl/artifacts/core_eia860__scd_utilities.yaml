  description: The dataset contains information on utility attributes compiled from
    EIA data, capturing annually varying details related to utility identification
    and operational data. Key fields include the EIA Utility Identification number,
    the reporting date, and the utility's physical street address, city, state, and
    zip code. It also outlines whether the utility is an owner, operator, asset manager,
    or holds any other relationship to power plants reported on Schedule 2 of the
    EIA form. The dataset includes the type of entity for the principal owner and
    a mail attention name if available. This comprehensive dataset can be used to
    track and analyze the roles and locations of utility entities over time.
