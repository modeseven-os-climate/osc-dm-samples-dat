  description: 'The dataset contains codes relating to the measurement units for particulate
    matter as reported in the EIA-860 form. It provides a coded system translating
    complex particulate matter data into understandable, human-readable formats. Specifically,
    it includes the following fields:


    1. Code: Originally reported short codes used for data representation.

    2. Label: Longer descriptions using snake_case format, offering clear and concise
    attribute names.

    3. Description: Detailed explanations of what each code and label represent.


    The dataset covers a range of particulate matter measurement units, such as percentage
    of opacity, pounds of particulate matter per million Btu in fuel, grains of particulate
    matter per standard cubic foot of stack gas, and pounds per thousand pounds of
    stack gas. Additionally, it includes a category for other types of measurements
    that are specified in a specific schedule. This coding table is useful for translating
    technical particulate matter data into more accessible terminology for analysis
    and reporting.'
