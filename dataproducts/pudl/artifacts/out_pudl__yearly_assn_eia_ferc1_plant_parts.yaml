  description: "This dataset offers a comprehensive linkage between power plant data\
    \ reported in the FERC Form 1 and associated data from the EIA. It contains 56,409\
    \ rows, where each entry corresponds to a specific FERC Form 1 record. The data\
    \ includes information from various tables that describe power plants, such as\
    \ those for large steam plants, hydro plants, small plants, and more. Each FERC\
    \ record may represent an entire plant, individual generators within a plant,\
    \ all generators in a plant with the same type of prime mover, or just the respondent\u2019\
    s ownership share of any of those categories, among others. The dataset provides\
    \ granularity as the same utility may report the same plant differently across\
    \ different years. The EIA data included in each record is derived from the Plant\
    \ Parts EIA table, representing an aggregation of several related data points.\
    \ This rich linkage allows for a more detailed and nuanced analysis of power plant\
    \ operations and ownership as reported by both FERC and EIA."
