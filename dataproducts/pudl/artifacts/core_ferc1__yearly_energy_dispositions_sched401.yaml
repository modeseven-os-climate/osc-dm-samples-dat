  description: The dataset "core_ferc1__yearly_energy_dispositions_sched401" provides
    detailed information on electric energy dispositions as reported by electricity
    utilities. The data includes various types of energy dispositions such as sales
    to customers, re-sales of energy, energy used internally, and losses. Each data
    entry consists of records uniquely identified by a PUDL-assigned utility ID and
    includes the year of the report. Additionally, the dataset specifies whether a
    row's value is calculated or uniquely reported. Energy dispositions are measured
    in megawatt-hours (MWh), providing a comprehensive view of the energy flow and
    distribution within the utility sector for the given report year. Each record
    is further traceable through a unique record ID from the original FERC Form 1
    source.
