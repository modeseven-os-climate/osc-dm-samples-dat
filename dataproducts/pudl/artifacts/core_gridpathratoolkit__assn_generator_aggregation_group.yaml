  description: The dataset contains information on the aggregation of generation profiles
    for electricity generators. It details which individual generator profiles are
    combined to create aggregated capacity factors and generation profiles. Each entry
    includes the unique six-digit facility identification number (plant_id_eia), the
    generator's ID (often numeric but can include letters), and a label for the aggregation
    group. The table also provides the total installed capacity in megawatts (capacity_mw)
    for each generator. This data allows users to understand how various generators'
    capacities contribute to aggregated profiles, which are crucial for analyzing
    and forecasting electricity generation patterns. The resulting aggregated profiles
    are stored in a separate dataset, ensuring comprehensive coverage for capacity
    planning and grid management applications. The data is licensed under CC-BY-4.0,
    which promotes data sharing and collaboration.
