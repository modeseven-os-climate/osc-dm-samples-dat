  description: The "core_eia860__assn_yearly_boiler_emissions_control_equipment" table
    provides detailed information about the emissions control equipment linked to
    boilers in various power plants. This table includes data on the unique identification
    numbers of both boilers and emissions control devices, focusing on pollutants
    such as NOx (nitrogen oxides), SO2 (sulfur dioxide), mercury, and particulates.
    The data includes the report date to specify when the data was recorded and utilizes
    unique plant identification numbers assigned by the Energy Information Administration
    (EIA). Additionally, the table contains an alphanumeric boiler ID for each boiler
    and specifies the type of emissions control device and its corresponding ID used
    for emissions data collection. The data also covers the level of maturity, indicating
    the completeness and finalization status of the data records. This table is critical
    for entities monitoring emissions and compliance with environmental regulations,
    as it allows the tracking and analysis of emissions control measures at a granular
    level.
