  description: 'The core_pudl__assn_ferc1_pudl_utilities table is a key resource for
    linking utility identifiers across different data systems. It maps two manually
    assigned utility IDs: the PUDL ID, which integrates utility information from both
    the EIA and FERC1 datasets, and the FERC1 ID, which bridges older DBF respondent
    IDs with newer XBRL entity IDs. This crosswalk allows for more seamless analyses
    and reporting across regulatory frameworks. The table includes 422 rows, each
    representing a unique utility, with columns for PUDL-assigned utility IDs (utility_id_ferc1),
    utility names as reported in FERC Form 1 (utility_name_ferc1), and manually assigned
    PUDL utility IDs (utility_id_pudl). This dataset is critical for utilities, analysts,
    and researchers who need to reconcile and analyze utility data from different
    federal regulatory forms, ensuring consistency and accuracy in data reporting
    and analysis. The data is updated regularly to maintain alignment with evolving
    utility information and is licensed under CC-BY-4.0, allowing for broad usability
    and application.'
