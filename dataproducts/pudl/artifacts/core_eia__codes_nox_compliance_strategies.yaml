  description: 'The dataset is a coding table that describes different compliance
    strategies used to control nitrogen oxide as reported in the EIA-860. It contains
    three main columns: code, label, and description. The "code" column includes originally
    reported short codes representing different compliance strategies. The "label"
    column provides longer, human-readable versions of these codes in snake_case format.
    The "description" column gives detailed explanations of what each code and label
    represents. For instance, the dataset includes codes such as "AA" for advanced_overfire_air,
    "BF" for biased_firing, and "BO" for burner out of service, among others. Each
    row in the dataset corresponds to a specific strategy for nitrogen oxide control,
    providing both a concise identifier and a more descriptive explanation of the
    strategy. This dataset can be instrumental for understanding and analyzing various
    nitrogen oxide compliance methods employed in energy generation and reporting.'
