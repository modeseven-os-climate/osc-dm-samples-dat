  description: The "Yearly Small Plants Schedule" table from FERC Form 1 provides
    detailed information on small plants reported by various utilities. It includes
    data for the four-digit year in which the report was made, and each entry is associated
    with unique IDs assigned to both the utility and the plant. This table captures
    the name of the utility, the plant name as reported to FERC, and an identifier
    for the original FERC Form 1 source record. The utility ID and plant ID are manually
    assigned within the PUDL system and help in identifying and tracking the utility
    and plant across reports. The dataset is particularly useful for understanding
    the small plants maintained by utilities and offers insights into plant-level
    details as reported annually to FERC.
