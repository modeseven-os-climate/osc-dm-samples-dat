  description: 'The dataset, based on information from the Energy Information Administration
    (EIA), encompasses monthly data on various attributes of electricity generators.
    It contains over 5 million rows of data, providing detailed insights into generator
    operations on a monthly basis. Key elements within the dataset include the unique
    plant identification number (plant_id_eia) and generator identification number
    (generator_id). Each record is tagged with a report date, signifying the month
    and year of the data.


    The dataset also includes dynamically assigned PUDL unit and plant IDs, which
    are useful for internal tracking but are subject to change over time. Each plant''s
    name is recorded, along with utility identification numbers and names, offering
    clarity on the operational and ownership spectrum of the facilities.


    Additional valuable information found in the dataset comprises technology descriptions,
    calculated capacity factors (indicating the performance and efficiency of generators),
    heat rates (a measure of efficiency related to energy consumption), and fuel costs
    both in total and per MMBTU (Million British Thermal Units). This level of detail
    presents a comprehensive view of energy production, generator efficiency, and
    cost metrics, making it useful for analysis by energy professionals, economists,
    and policy makers.'
