  description: The core_ferc1__yearly_steam_plants_fuel_sched402 dataset provides
    detailed annual data on fuel costs and quantities for steam plants with a capacity
    of 25 megawatts or more, as well as internal combustion and gas-turbine plants
    of 10 megawatts or more, including all nuclear plants. The data is sourced from
    page 402 of Form 1, submitted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC),
    and includes information extracted from the f1_fuel table in FERC's FoxPro Database.
    Each record in the dataset includes a unique identifier indicating the original
    FERC Form 1 source record, a PUDL-assigned utility ID for identifying the utility,
    the year the data was reported, and the name of the plant as reported to FERC.
    This data can be valuable for analyzing fuel consumption, cost patterns, and operational
    efficiency for large-scale power plants over time.
