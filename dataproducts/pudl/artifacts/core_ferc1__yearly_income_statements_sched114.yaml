  description: This dataset contains detailed yearly income statements from the Federal
    Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Form 1, specifically from Schedule 114. It
    includes over 330,000 rows of data from various utility companies. Each entry
    provides a wealth of financial information, including a unique record identifier,
    utility ID, report year, utility type (such as Electric Utility or Gas Utility),
    and the type of income reported. The dataset captures the dollar value of reported
    income, expenses, assets, or liabilities, along with an indication of whether
    these values are credits or debits. The specific FERC account associated with
    each entry is also detailed, allowing for granular analysis of financial performance
    across different utilities and reporting periods. This dataset is especially useful
    for financial analysts, regulators, researchers, and stakeholders interested in
    the financial health and operational performance of utility companies in the United
    States. The data is available under a CC-BY-4.0 license, encouraging wide use
    and analysis.
