  description: The core_eia__yearly_fuel_receipts_costs_aggs dataset from the EIA
    (Energy Information Administration) contains aggregated data on fuel receipts
    and costs for the bulk electricity sector. It offers valuable insights into the
    category of fuel received, geographic and sectoral aggregations, and temporal
    distribution. Key data points include the report date, total fuel received measured
    in MMBtu (million British thermal units), and the average cost per MMBtu in nominal
    USD. This dataset is essential for analyzing trends in fuel supply and cost dynamics
    across different regions, fuel types, and time frames, making it a vital resource
    for businesses involved in energy production, policy making, and market analysis.
