  description: 'The dataset "Fuel Receipts and Costs" from the EIA-923 Schedule 2,
    Part A, provides detailed information about fuel deliveries to power plants. Each
    record in the dataset documents an individual fuel delivery, which means multiple
    entries can pertain to the same type of fuel from the same supplier to the same
    plant within a single month. The data includes various attributes such as the
    amount of fuel received, the type of fuel, the supplier, the delivery date, and
    the costs associated with the delivery.


    This dataset is crucial for analyzing fuel costs as it offers the most detailed
    and granular data available on fuel deliveries and their associated costs. However,
    it is important to note that there can be a delay between the receipt of fuel
    and its actual consumption, which may affect monthly attributes related to power
    generation. Despite this limitation, the dataset is used to calculate the marginal
    cost of electricity for individual generation units.


    In some cases, utilities treat the price of fuel as proprietary business information,
    resulting in redacted costs in the publicly available spreadsheets. The data,
    however, is still reported to the EIA and contributes to aggregated statistics
    at the state, regional, and national levels.'
