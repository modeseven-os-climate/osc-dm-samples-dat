  description: The dataset known as out_eia923__yearly_generation provides detailed
    information on net electricity generation by individual reporting generators,
    compiled on a monthly basis from the EIA-923 Schedule 3. This dataset covers approximately
    56,879 rows of data. It primarily includes data that details how much electricity
    different generators are producing monthly, although this represents only about
    half of the total generation reported due to varying reporting requirements for
    different generator types and sizes. This generator-level data is crucial for
    estimating the heat rates of generation units and calculating the marginal cost
    of electricity on a per-generator basis. However, such calculations also depend
    on additional data such as plant-level fuel costs and accurate or complete boiler-generator
    associations. It is also important to note that a minor segment of respondents
    only provide annual net generation data, which is reported in December, potentially
    influencing the uniformity and granularity of the dataset.
