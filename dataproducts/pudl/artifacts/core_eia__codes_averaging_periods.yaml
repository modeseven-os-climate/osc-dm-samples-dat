  description: 'The data set "core_eia__codes_averaging_periods" provides a comprehensive
    overview of various averaging periods specified by emissions statutes and regulations
    as reported in the EIA-860. It includes 17 rows, each representing a unique code
    used to denote different timeframes for averaging emissions data. The dataset
    features three main columns: "code," "label," and "description." The "code" column
    contains the originally reported short codes for averaging periods. The "label"
    provides longer, human-readable versions of these codes in snake_case format.
    The "description" column offers detailed explanations of what each code represents.
    For example, the code "DA" corresponds to a 24-hour period, while "EH" denotes
    an eight-hour duration. Other timeframes covered range from five minutes to ninety
    days, with some entries indicating periods defined by testing or cases where the
    averaging period is not specified. This dataset serves as a valuable resource
    for understanding the timeframes used in emissions reporting and regulation compliance.'
