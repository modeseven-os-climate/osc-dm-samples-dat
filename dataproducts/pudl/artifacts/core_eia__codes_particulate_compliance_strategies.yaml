  description: This dataset provides a comprehensive overview of the various compliance
    strategies used to control particulate matter, as reported in the EIA-860. The
    table includes a short code for each strategy, a longer, human-readable version
    of this code formatted in snake_case, and a detailed description explaining the
    strategy. The dataset features nine distinct compliance strategies, including
    "Burner out of service," "Flue gas recirculation," "Low excess air," "Low NOx
    burner," and "Boiler currently meeting standard," among others. This information
    is crucial for understanding the different methods employed by facilities to adhere
    to particulate matter regulations and can be used for analysis, reporting, and
    regulatory compliance tracking.
