  description: The data set "core_eia860_assn_boiler_cooling" contains information
    about the associations between boilers and cooling systems in energy facilities,
    as documented by the Energy Information Administration (EIA). It includes a unique
    six-digit plant identification number assigned by EIA (plant_id_eia), alphanumeric
    boiler IDs (boiler_id), and EIA identification codes for cooling systems (cooling_id_eia).
    The data also includes the date the information was reported (report_date) and
    the maturity level of the data record, indicating whether the data is final or
    less-than-final (data_maturity). This dataset provides a comprehensive linkage
    between individual boilers and their corresponding cooling systems across various
    plants, facilitating detailed analysis of cooling technologies in energy production.
