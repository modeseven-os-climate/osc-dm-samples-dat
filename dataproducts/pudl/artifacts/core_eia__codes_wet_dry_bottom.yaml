  description: 'The dataset titled ''core_eia__codes_wet_dry_bottom'' provides a coding
    table that describes whether a boiler has a wet or dry bottom, which is reported
    in the EIA-860 database. It comprises two rows of data with three main attributes:
    code, label, and description. The ''code'' attribute includes short codes (''D''
    for dry bottom and ''W'' for wet bottom), which serve as abbreviations. The ''label''
    attribute gives a more human-readable name using snake_case (''dry_bottom'' and
    ''wet_bottom''). The ''description'' attribute provides detailed explanations
    of what the codes mean, such as whether the boiler has no slag tanks at the furnace
    throat area (dry bottom) or contains slag tanks to manage molten ash (wet bottom).
    This dataset is essential for understanding specific characteristics of boilers
    as reported in energy information databases.'
