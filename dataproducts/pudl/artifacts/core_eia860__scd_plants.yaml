  description: The dataset contains annually varying plant attributes compiled from
    the EIA-860 and EIA-923 data. It includes a unique six-digit facility identification
    number (also known as ORISPL) assigned by the Energy Information Administration.
    The dataset records include the report date and details about ash impoundments
    at the plants, specifying whether they exist, if they are lined, and their status
    as of December 31 of the reporting year. It also includes the short code and name
    of the balancing authority overseeing the plant, the geodetic coordinate system
    identifier (e.g., NAD27, NAD83, WGS84), and an indication of whether the facility
    has energy storage capabilities. This comprehensive dataset provides a detailed
    overview of key operational and environmental attributes of energy plants over
    annual periods.
