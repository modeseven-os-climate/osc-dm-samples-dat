  description: "The EIA-923 Monthly Generation and Fuel Consumption Time Series data\
    \ provides comprehensive information on electricity generation and fuel consumption\
    \ spanning multiple years. This dataset includes denormalized, combined data from\
    \ the monthly generation and fuel reports, specifically merging fossil fuel data\
    \ with nuclear generation aggregated at the plant prime mover level to ensure\
    \ compatibility across different energy sources. \n\nKey data elements include\
    \ the report date, unique six-digit facility identification numbers (plant ID)\
    \ assigned by the Energy Information Administration, and manually assigned PUDL\
    \ plant IDs, which might vary over time. The plant names and utility names are\
    \ also provided, alongside their respective identification numbers for reference\
    \ within EIA and PUDL databases. Each record details the various energy sources\
    \ used, facilitating analysis of fuel consumption and electricity generation trends\
    \ across different plants and utility operators. This data is critical for understanding\
    \ the dynamics of power production and resource utilization in the energy sector."
