  description: The dataset contains detailed information on generator ownership reported
    in EIA-860 Schedule 4. It includes data for generators that are either jointly
    owned or owned by third parties. Key data fields include the date the information
    was reported, the unique six-digit facility identification number assigned by
    the Energy Information Administration (EIA), and a manually assigned PUDL plant
    ID which may not be constant over time. The dataset also includes the name of
    the plant and the EIA utility identification number for the owner company responsible
    for the day-to-day operations of the generator, as well as a manually assigned
    PUDL utility ID, which also may not be stable over time. Additionally, the dataset
    provides the name of the EIA owner utility and the generator ID, which can be
    numeric or include letters. This dataset is valuable for analyzing and understanding
    the ownership structures of power generation facilities over time.
