  description: The dataset core_ferc714__respondent_id contains identification information
    for respondents to FERC Form 714, Part I, Schedule 1. Each record in this dataset
    includes a unique FERC Form 714 respondent ID, the name of the utility, balancing
    area authority, or planning authority that is responding, and an associated EIA
    utility or balancing area authority ID. While many utilities also serve as balancing
    authorities and may use the same EIA ID in both capacities, there is no requirement
    for these IDs to be the same and in some cases they are different. The dataset
    consists of 213 rows, each providing these identification details, which can be
    used to cross-reference and identify entities involved in energy regulation and
    reporting.
