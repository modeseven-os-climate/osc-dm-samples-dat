  description: "The dataset \"out_ferc1__yearly_energy_sources_sched401\" contains\
    \ detailed information on energy sources reported by various utilities in their\
    \ FERC Form 1 filings. It includes records from multiple years with a total of\
    \ 36,564 rows. Each record provides several key pieces of information: \n\n- PUDL-assigned\
    \ utility ID (`utility_id_ferc1`), which may change annually.\n- Manually assigned,\
    \ more stable utility ID (`utility_id_pudl`).\n- The name of the utility, as reported\
    \ in the form (`utility_name_ferc1`).\n- The year in which the data was reported\
    \ (`report_year`), represented in a four-digit format.\n- The type of energy source,\
    \ categorized into generation, power exchanges, and transmission (`energy_source_type`).\n\
    - A field indicating whether the row's value was calculated or uniquely reported\
    \ within the form (`row_type_xbrl`).\n- The amount of energy in megawatt-hours\
    \ (`energy_mwh`), indicating either sources or uses of energy.\n\nThis data is\
    \ essential for analyzing the energy production, exchange, and transmission patterns\
    \ of different utilities over various years, providing a comprehensive view of\
    \ the energy landscape as reported to FERC."
