  description: "The dataset provides projected generation capacity and total generation\
    \ in the end-use sector, categorized by fuel type. It includes data on combined-heat-and-power\
    \ plants and electricity-only plants within the commercial and industrial sectors,\
    \ as well as small on-site generating systems in the residential, commercial,\
    \ and industrial sectors. These systems are primarily used for own-use generation\
    \ but may also contribute power to the grid. Solar photovoltaic capacity is reported\
    \ in megawatts direct current, while other technologies are presented in megawatts\
    \ alternating current. The dataset spans over 77,000 rows and includes information\
    \ such as the four-digit report year, the AEO projection region, and factors affecting\
    \ the projection like economic growth, future oil prices, the size of domestic\
    \ energy resources, and technological changes. \n\nThis dataset can be particularly\
    \ useful for analyzing trends in energy generation, assessing the growth of different\
    \ energy technologies, and understanding regional differences in energy production.\
    \ It serves as a valuable resource for stakeholders in the energy industry, policymakers,\
    \ researchers, and businesses focusing on energy planning and sustainability."
