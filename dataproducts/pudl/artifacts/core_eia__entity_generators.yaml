  description: The dataset "core_eia__entity_generators" comprises static generator
    attributes drawn from the EIA-860 and EIA-923 data, encapsulating 38,717 rows.
    It provides detailed information about various generators across facilities, identified
    uniquely by a six-digit plant identifier (plant_id_eia) and a generator-specific
    identifier (generator_id). Key data fields include the operational attributes
    of these generators, such as the presence of duct burners (duct_burners) for supplementary
    firing, the date when the generator commenced commercial operations (generator_operating_date),
    and its role in a combined heat and power system, specifying either a topping
    cycle or a bottoming cycle (topping_bottoming_code). Additionally, the dataset
    indicates whether each generator is integrated into a solid fuel gasification
    system (solid_fuel_gasification) or employs pulverized coal technology (pulverized_coal_tech).
    This information captures both the technological specifics and operational history
    of electricity generation units, facilitating comprehensive analysis and strategic
    planning for stakeholders in the energy sector.
