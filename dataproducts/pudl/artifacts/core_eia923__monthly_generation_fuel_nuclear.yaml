  description: The EIA-923 Monthly Generation and Fuel Consumption Time Series dataset
    provides detailed information on monthly electricity generation and fuel consumption
    for nuclear generation units. Each record in this dataset includes a unique plant
    identification number, the report date, the nuclear unit ID, and the energy source
    code. This dataset is extracted from Schedule 3 of the EIA-923 form and specifically
    pertains to nuclear power plants. The unique plant identification number, also
    known as ORISPL, is a six-digit code assigned by the Energy Information Administration
    (EIA). The nuclear unit ID is a one-digit numeric value that identifies each nuclear
    generation unit within a plant. The energy source code is a brief alphanumeric
    code indicating the type of energy source used. This comprehensive dataset provides
    essential insights into the performance and fuel consumption patterns of nuclear
    power plants across different time periods, facilitating in-depth analysis and
    decision-making for energy management and policy development.
