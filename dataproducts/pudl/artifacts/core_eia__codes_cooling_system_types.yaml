  description: 'The core_eia__codes_cooling_system_types table is a comprehensive
    dataset that provides detailed information about various cooling system types
    used in energy production as reported by the U.S. Energy Information Administration
    (EIA). This dataset includes 18 entries where each entry contains three main fields:
    code, label, and description.


    - The "code" field contains the originally reported short codes for different
    cooling system types.

    - The "label" field provides a longer, human-readable version of these codes using
    snake_case formatting.

    - The "description" field gives a thorough explanation of what each code and label
    represent in terms of the cooling system''s characteristics and functionality.


    This dataset allows users to understand and identify the specific type of cooling
    systems that are employed in power generation facilities, such as dry cooling,
    hybrid cooling, and various hybrid configurations involving both wet and dry cooling
    systems. Such information can be pivotal for energy analysts, environmental researchers,
    regulatory bodies, and businesses involved in energy management and infrastructure
    planning.'
