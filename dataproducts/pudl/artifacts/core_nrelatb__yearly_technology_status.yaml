  description: The core_nrelatb__yearly_technology_status data set is an annual table
    that features detailed information about various electricity generation technologies
    and their status within Annual Technology Baseline (ATB) scenarios. For each reporting
    year, the data set includes descriptions of the technologies used by generators
    to produce electricity. It provides high-level and detailed descriptions, offering
    insights into specific resource levels and technology subcategories. Additionally,
    the data indicates whether a particular technology is considered mature or if
    it is classified as the default technology within the ATB scenarios. This data
    set consists of 515 rows, capturing a broad and detailed overview of technology
    statuses across various years. The table helps stakeholders understand the development,
    maturity, and default status of energy generation technologies over time.
