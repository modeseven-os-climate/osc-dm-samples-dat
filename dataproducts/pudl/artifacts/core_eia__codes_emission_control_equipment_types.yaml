  description: The dataset provides a detailed inventory of emissions control equipment
    types installed on boilers. It includes a code for each type of equipment which
    is a short, originally reported identifier. Additionally, there is a more descriptive
    label in snake_case for easier reading, and a full description explaining what
    each code and label means. The data covers 24 different emissions control equipment
    types, each identified by specific codes such as ACI for activated carbon injection
    systems, BP for baghouse (fabric filter), pulse, and similar codes for other types
    of control equipment like baghouse reverse air and baghouse shake deflate. This
    dataset is essential for understanding the various methods employed for controlling
    emissions in boilers, and it provides clear, structured descriptions to facilitate
    analysis and reporting.
