  description: The core_eia861__yearly_reliability dataset contains essential metrics
    pertaining to electricity system reliability and the impacts of outages. It includes
    standardized reliability indices such as the System Average Interruption Duration
    Index (SAIDI), the System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI), and the
    Customer Average Interruption Duration Index (CAIDI). These indices are provided
    with and without the inclusion of major event days and loss of service incidents.
    The dataset also includes information on the average number of minutes per interruption,
    considering both major event days and loss of service events separately. Additionally,
    it contains data on the number of customers affected and the types of entities
    involved. This dataset is valuable for understanding the reliability performance
    of electricity systems and can be used for benchmarking and improving service
    quality. It is available under the CC-BY-4.0 license, allowing for broad use and
    distribution with proper attribution.
