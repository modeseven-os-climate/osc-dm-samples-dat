  description: The core_eia861__yearly_demand_response dataset provides comprehensive
    information on energy demand response programs across the United States, categorized
    by state, sector, and balancing authority. This dataset comprises data collected
    from 2013 onwards, following a format change that split the previous demand-side
    management table into separate energy efficiency and demand response tables. The
    dataset includes details on the number of customers enrolled in demand response
    programs, total energy savings achieved, potential savings, actual peak savings
    realized, and the associated costs of these initiatives. The information is highly
    detailed and specific, offering insights into how different regions and sectors
    are managing and benefiting from demand response activities, which aim to reduce
    energy consumption during peak demand periods. This data is crucial for analyzing
    the effectiveness of demand response initiatives and planning future energy management
    strategies.
