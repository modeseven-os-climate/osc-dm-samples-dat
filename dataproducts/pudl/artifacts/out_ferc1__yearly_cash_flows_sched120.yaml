  description: The FERC Form 1 Yearly Cash Flows dataset contains detailed financial
    data reported by utilities to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).
    The dataset captures a variety of cash flow-related information, including changes
    in balances and specific monetary amounts, as reported on an annual basis. Each
    record in the dataset is uniquely identified and includes key attributes such
    as the report year, a PUDL-assigned utility ID for uniquely identifying each utility,
    and the original utility name as reported to FERC. The dataset is intended to
    provide insights into the cash flow activities of utilities, covering data points
    like operational cash inflows and outflows, financing activities, and investment
    expenditures. This information can be instrumental for financial analysts, policy
    makers, and other stakeholders who seek to understand the financial health and
    operational efficiency of utility companies.
