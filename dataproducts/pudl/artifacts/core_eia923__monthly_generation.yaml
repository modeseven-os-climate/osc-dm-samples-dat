  description: The EIA-923 Monthly Generation dataset provides detailed information
    on the net electricity generated by individual reporting generators on a monthly
    basis. This dataset is crucial for understanding the monthly generation performance
    of generators, but it captures about half of the total generation due to varying
    reporting requirements for different generator types and sizes. This dataset supports
    the estimation of generator-specific heat rates and marginal electricity costs,
    though these calculations often rely on plant-level fuel cost data and may face
    challenges due to boiler-generator association uncertainties. A small number of
    respondents in the dataset only provide annual net generation data, which is reported
    entirely under December. This dataset serves as a granular source for analyzing
    the output of electrical generation units and for making detailed performance
    and cost assessments based on actual reported generation data.
