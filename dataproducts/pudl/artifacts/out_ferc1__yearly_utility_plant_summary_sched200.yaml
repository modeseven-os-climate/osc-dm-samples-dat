  description: 'The dataset, named out_ferc1__yearly_utility_plant_summary_sched200,
    is a denormalized table that contains detailed information regarding utility plant
    summaries as reported annually in FERC Form 1. It includes 191,991 rows of data
    and is licensed under CC-BY-4.0. This dataset features several key attributes
    such as:


    1. utility_id_ferc1: A unique, auto-incremented identifier assigned by PUDL to
    each utility in the dataset. Note that this ID may vary year to year and should
    not be considered stable.

    2. utility_id_pudl: A manually assigned identifier by PUDL, designed to be consistent
    and stable over time for each utility.

    3. utility_name_ferc1: The name of the utility as it is reported in FERC Form
    1, primarily for human readability.

    4. report_year: The year in which the data was reported, represented as a four-digit
    number.

    5. utility_type: A classification of the utility plant types included in the summary,
    such as Electric Utility, Gas Utility, and Other Utility.

    6. utility_type_other: A freeform description provided when the utility does not
    fall under the predefined categories of Electric, Gas, or Other Utility. This
    field is populated only in the specific reporting years it was recorded in the
    DBF format.


    The dataset enables analysis and comparison of utility plants over time, fostering
    a deeper understanding of trends and patterns within different utility types and
    aiding stakeholders in making data-informed decisions.'
