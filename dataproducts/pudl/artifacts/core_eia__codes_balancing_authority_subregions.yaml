  description: 'This product contains detailed information about balancing authority
    subregions as reported in EIA-930. It comprises 84 rows of data, each representing
    a different subregion. For each entry, three key attributes are provided: the
    balancing authority code (a short code identifying the relevant balancing authority,
    which may include those in Canada and Mexico), the balancing authority subregion
    code (which specifies the code identifying specific subregions within larger balancing
    authorities), and the balancing authority subregion name (the descriptive name
    of the subregion). This data is fundamental for understanding the structure and
    organization of balancing authorities and their subregions, which is crucial for
    energy management, distribution planning, and grid reliability analysis.'
