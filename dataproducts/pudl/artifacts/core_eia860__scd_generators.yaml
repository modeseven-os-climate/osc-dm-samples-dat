  description: 'This dataset, compiled from the EIA-860 and EIA-923 data, contains
    annually varying attributes for generators in the U.S. energy sector. The dataset
    includes 591,509 records and covers several key attributes for each generator.


    The unique Plant ID (plant_id_eia) is a six-digit identifier assigned by the Energy
    Information Administration (EIA) to each facility. The Generator ID (generator_id)
    is a string that can include both numbers and letters. Each record also includes
    the EIA Utility Identification number (utility_id_eia).


    The dataset specifies the date information was reported (report_date) and details
    the operational status of each generator, both in code form (operational_status_code)
    and descriptive form (operational_status), indicating whether the generator is
    operational, planned, or retired, among other statuses. The ownership structure
    of each generator is identified by the ownership_code.


    For capacity, the dataset includes the total installed (nameplate) capacity in
    megawatts (capacity_mw), the net summer capacity (summer_capacity_mw), and indicates
    whether the summer capacity value was an estimate (summer_capacity_estimate).


    This rich dataset is essential for analyzing the operational dynamics, capacity,
    and ownership of power generators across the United States, enabling stakeholders
    to make informed decisions in energy production, distribution, and policy-making.'
