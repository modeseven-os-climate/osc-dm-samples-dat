  description: "The dataset \"core_eia861__yearly_utility_data_rto\" contains detailed\
    \ annual information about the operations of utilities in various regions and\
    \ their participation in Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs). Each entry\
    \ in the dataset includes the following fields:\n\n1. NERC Region: The North American\
    \ Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) region where the utility operates.\n\
    2. Report Date: The date when the data was reported.\n3. RTOs of Operation: The\
    \ specific Independent System Operators (ISOs) or RTOs where the utility conducts\
    \ its operations.\n4. State: The two-letter abbreviation of the U.S. state in\
    \ which the utility is located.\n5. Utility ID EIA: The unique identification\
    \ number assigned to the utility by the U.S. Energy Information Administration\
    \ (EIA).\n6. Data Maturity: An indicator of the maturity level of the data record.\
    \ This field highlights that some data records may be less mature or final and\
    \ advises on the reliability of such records. \n\nOverall, the dataset contains\
    \ 20,909 rows, each representing a unique record of a utility's operational data\
    \ within different RTOs across the United States. This dataset is essential for\
    \ analyzing the interplay between utilities and RTOs, assessing regional participation,\
    \ and tracking changes over time in utility operations across various NERC regions."
