  description: 'The "FERC Electricity Sales by Rate Schedule" dataset provides detailed
    information regarding yearly electricity sales by rate schedules as reported in
    the FERC Form 1. This comprehensive dataset includes 291,979 rows of denormalized
    data and covers several critical attributes. You will find the following key data
    points:


    1. utility_id_ferc1: This is a PUDL-assigned utility ID that identifies a specific
    FERC1 utility. It''s an auto-incremented ID and may not remain stable over different
    years.

    2. utility_id_pudl: A manually assigned PUDL utility ID which similarly may not
    remain stable over time.

    3. utility_name_ferc1: The name of the utility as reported in the FERC Form 1,
    provided for human readability.

    4. report_year: The four-digit year in which the data was reported.

    5. rate_schedule_type: This denotes the categorization of the rate schedule type
    under which the sales data is organized.

    6. billing_status: Indicates whether the amount is billed, unbilled, or both.
    Billed amounts relate to actual energy exchanges, whereas unbilled amounts pertain
    to other revenue sources such as contracts for standby services or renting space
    for cell antennas on transmission infrastructure.


    This dataset serves as a valuable resource for the analysis of electricity sales
    trends, utility performance over time, and the assessment of various rate schedules.
    It is crucial for stakeholders such as utility companies, regulatory bodies, and
    researchers aiming to understand the nuances of energy sales and revenue within
    the utility sector.'
