  description: 'The EIA-860 Annual Report on energy storage provides a comprehensive
    dataset capturing various attributes of energy storage facilities in the United
    States. Key data points include the unique six-digit facility identification number
    (plant_id_eia) assigned by the Energy Information Administration, as well as a
    generator ID (generator_id) which can be alphanumeric. Each entry also includes
    the report date, providing a time reference for the dataset.


    The dataset includes critical technical specifications for energy storage units
    such as the maximum charge rate in megawatts (max_charge_rate_mw) and the maximum
    discharge rate in megawatts (max_discharge_rate_mw), which indicate the efficiency
    and capacity of the storage systems. Additionally, the storage enclosure code
    (storage_enclosure_code) identifies the type of enclosure housing the storage
    system, and the storage technology code (storage_technology_code) specifies the
    electro-chemical storage technology used. This dataset is essential for understanding
    the deployment, capacity, and operational characteristics of energy storage systems
    across the United States.'
