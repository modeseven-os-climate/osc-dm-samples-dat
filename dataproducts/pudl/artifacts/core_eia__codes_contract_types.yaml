  description: The core EIA codes for contract types dataset provides information
    about various types of fuel supply contracts reported in the EIA-923 form. It
    includes a coding table that highlights different contract categories. The key
    fields present in the data are "code," "label," and "description." Each row in
    the table represents a unique contract type with a corresponding short code, a
    longer human-readable code formatted in snake_case, and a comprehensive description
    explaining the meaning of the code and label. The dataset contains entries for
    contracts with terms of one year or longer, new contracts with similar duration,
    and distinctions between contracted and spot purchases. Users can leverage this
    dataset to understand the classification of fuel supply contracts as reported
    to the EIA.
