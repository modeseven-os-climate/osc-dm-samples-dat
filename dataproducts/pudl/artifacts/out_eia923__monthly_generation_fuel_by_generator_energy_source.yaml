  description: The dataset contains detailed monthly estimates of net electricity
    generation and fuel consumption for each combination of generator, energy source,
    and prime mover. It specifically breaks down the net electricity generation and
    fuel consumption as reported in the EIA-923 forms, allocating them to individual
    generators and then aggregating these allocations to unique combinations of generator,
    prime mover, and energy source codes. The process does not differentiate between
    primary and secondary energy sources for generators and assumes equal allocation
    of net generation between energy source codes in the case of multiple generators
    with the same prime mover but different energy sources. This dataset offers comprehensive
    insights into the specific contributions of different generators, energy sources,
    and prime movers to the overall energy production and fuel usage at a granular,
    monthly level.
