  description: 'This dataset provides a comprehensive summary of fuel data for steam
    plants as reported through FERC Form 1. It contains 26,188 rows of data, detailing
    yearly information for various plants. Each entry includes the report year, utility
    ID both from FERC and PUDL, and the utility name as reported to FERC. It also
    specifies the PUDL-assigned plant ID and the plant name as reported to FERC.


    The dataset focuses on the cost and heat content of coal as a fuel source. Specifically,
    it includes the cost of coal as a percentage of overall fuel costs and the coal
    heat content as a fraction of the total heat content, measured in MMBtu (million
    British thermal units). This dataset is valuable for analyzing the financial and
    operational aspects of steam plants, particularly in relation to their fuel consumption
    and costs. It can be used to track trends over time, compare different utilities
    and plants, and assess the impact of fuel costs on overall plant operations. The
    data is licensed under CC-BY-4.0, allowing for wide use and dissemination with
    appropriate attribution.'
