  description: 'The core_eia861__yearly_net_metering_customer_fuel_class dataset provides
    detailed information on energy sold back to the grid by net metering customers
    from 2007 to the present. Initially, from 2007 to 2009, the data are reported
    as a lump sum of total energy dispatched by sector. Post-2009, the dataset includes
    more granular data broken down by sector and technology type. Key data points
    include:


    - balancing_authority_code_eia: EIA short code identifying a balancing authority,
    which may include Canadian and Mexican BAs.

    - capacity_mw: Total installed (nameplate) capacity in megawatts.

    - customer_class: High-level categorization of customer types, such as commercial,
    industrial, direct connection, other, residential, total, transportation, and
    commercial_other.

    - customers: Number of customers participating in net metering.

    - report_date: The date when the data were reported.

    - short_form: Indicates whether the data come from the short form of the EIA 861
    form, which is a shorter version used for reporting.


    This dataset is valuable for understanding the contributions of different types
    of customers and technologies to energy generation and grid stability. It is useful
    for analysts, policymakers, and businesses involved in energy management and planning.
    The data are licensed under CC-BY-4.0, allowing for broad use and distribution.'
